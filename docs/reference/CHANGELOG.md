# Aura Frog - Changelog

All notable changes to Aura Frog will be documented in this file.

---

## [Unreleased] (Context economy: slim the always-on CLAUDE.md trio)

> Applied the plugin's own lazy-load principle to its own CLAUDE.md files. Maintainer-only procedure and reference catalogs were costing always-on context every session; they now lazy-load from `docs/`. Net: **~1,685 tokens cut from every session** (~48% of the project CLAUDE.md).

### Fixed

- **`with_lock` no longer mints duplicate IDs under CPU starvation (P0-4 regression).** The `mkdir`-spinlock in `scripts/plans/_lib.sh` broke a "stale" lock purely by age (`AF_LOCK_TIMEOUT_SEC`). Under heavy parallel load a *live but off-CPU* holder would age past the threshold, a waiter would steal its lock, and two writers would enter the read-modify-write at once → **duplicate counter IDs** — the exact P0-4 bug the lock was added to prevent, resurfacing as a flaky `next-counter-lock.test.cjs` that failed only inside the oversubscribed CI jest run. Fix: stale-break is now **liveness-gated** — the holder writes its PID (`BASHPID`, `$$` fallback) into the lock dir and a waiter breaks the lock only when that PID is dead, or (for the sub-ms mkdir→pid window with no PID) after a decoupled `AF_LOCK_STALE_SEC` (default `max(timeout,60)`). Reproduced before/after: old code 3/30 stress runs minted dupes under load, new code 0/30; full scripts suite 105/105 green.
- **Pre-flight no longer bricks a session when `jq` is missing.** The Tier-1 shell linters parse the tool payload JSON with `jq`. On a machine without jq installed, `scripts/preflight/validate-tool-input.sh` read empty fields for a perfectly valid payload and FALSELY reported `preflight:tool-input FAIL: <Tool> tool missing <field>` (exit 2) — blocking **every** Bash/Read/Write/Edit call and making the whole session unusable. Now fails open, matching the repo's existing "runs with or without jq" convention: `validate-tool-input.sh` skips shape validation when jq is absent, and `hooks/pre-flight-validate.cjs` short-circuits before running any linter (new `jqAvailable()` guard), printing a one-time `install jq to re-enable checks` notice instead of blocking. Regression-tested in `__tests__/hooks/preflight-validate-stdin.test.cjs`.

### Changed

- **`.claude/CLAUDE.md` slimmed 257 → 97 lines** — the Documentation Update Rule, Frontmatter Maintenance Rule, Commands-vs-Skills architecture, and Reference Integrity contract moved to **`docs/reference/MAINTENANCE.md`** (they only apply when editing plugin source, not every session). The runtime `User Confirmation Required` directive stays; a one-line pointer + audit-script invocation replaces the moved blocks.
- **`aura-frog/CLAUDE.md` Status Line section** compressed (24 lines of render spec → 1 directive line); full spec moved to **`docs/reference/STATUSLINE.md`**.
- **De-duplicated component counts** — plugin purpose line no longer restates `15 agents + 56 skills + 24 commands`; **Resources** table is now the single source. Synced version drift: global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/CLAUDE.md` header/footer → `3.8.0-alpha.7` (matching `plugin.json`).

### Added

- **`scripts/audit/audit-refs.sh`** — extracts the 3 inline bash audit blocks (zero-orphan, zero-dead-link, `user-invocable: false`) into one runnable gate. Fixes a latent bug in the inline version (it stripped `.md`, false-flagging `agents/architect`) and filters prose enumerations like `(agents/skills/rules)`. Exits 0 clean / 1 on violation.
- **`docs/reference/MAINTENANCE.md`** — the maintainer contract (doc-update, count/version sync, frontmatter schema, commands-vs-skills, reference integrity).
- **`docs/reference/STATUSLINE.md`** — full status-line rendering reference.

### Why

The repo preaches lazy-loading (Golden Rule #2) but its always-on CLAUDE.md trio carried ~3.5K tokens of maintenance procedure, reference catalogs, and drift-prone counts. Per Karpathy's context-engineering principle (CLAUDE.md is always-on prompt budget, not documentation), this is the highest-leverage cut. Zero runtime change.

## [3.8.0-alpha.8] - 2026-07-16 (Design Intelligence v2 — FEAT-009 ships)

> Closes the long-blocked FEAT-009 tail and adds the missing vision + design-system-persistence layers.
> Driven by the 2026-07-16 deep-research pass (Anthropic frontend-design skill, Agent SDK vision loop,
> Google Stitch MCP, superdesign). Full design: `docs/architecture/LLD-DESIGN-INTELLIGENCE.md`.

### Added

- **`skills/design-vision-loop`** — the missing "look at it" step. Renders the running UI via the Playwright
  MCP, screenshots it across 3 viewports + dark mode, runs a deterministic tier-1 gate (the new
  design-conformance hook + console errors) **before** spending a vision call, then critiques the shots
  against the design system and iterates (max 3). Two-tier by design — Anthropic ranks rules-based feedback
  above LLM-as-judge. Ships with `references/critique-rubric.md` + `references/viewport-matrix.md`.
- **`hooks/design-conformance.cjs`** (PostToolUse `Write|Edit`) — deterministic design gate that finally
  enforces what `theme-consistency` / `design-system-usage` / `motion-design` only described in prose:
  hardcoded hex/rgb, raw px/numeric spacing, one file importing 2+ component libraries, and
  animation/transition with no `prefers-reduced-motion` guard. Warnings only, fail-open, skips token/theme
  files. 27 unit tests; RED caught two real regex bugs before merge.
- **`rules/agent/design-system-persistence.md`** — `.claude/design/design-system.md` as the durable design
  source of truth (schema + producers/consumers), so tokens/type/library survive across sessions instead of
  being re-picked each time (pattern from Stitch `design.md` / superdesign `.superdesign/design-system.md`).
- **Google Stitch MCP** — opt-in remote server in `.mcp.json` (`stitch`, http transport, `STITCH_API_KEY`),
  disabled by default like the other opt-ins.

### Changed

- **`skills/stitch-design`** rewritten — dropped the stale "Stitch has no API" claim; now prefers the MCP
  (generate/edit screens + design-system tools, Flash-for-drafts quota discipline) and keeps the manual
  copy-paste flow as a graceful fallback. Seeds `.claude/design/design-system.md` + saves screen PNGs as
  vision-loop targets.
- **`skills/frontend-aesthetics` → v2** — added Anthropic's two-pass process (compact design plan →
  self-critique against the brief before coding), named the specific AI-default clusters to avoid
  (cream+serif+terracotta, dark+acid-green, hairline-broadsheet), and a screenshot self-critique directive.
- **`skills/design-tokens`, `skills/design-expert`, `agents/frontend`** — now write/read the design SoT file.
- **Figma tool-mismatch fixed** — prompts referenced Dev-Mode-MCP tools (`get_variable_defs`/
  `get_code_connect_map`) that the installed `figma-developer-mcp` doesn't expose; corrected to
  `get_figma_data` / `download_figma_images`.
- **Counts synced** — skills 59→60, rules 71→72, hooks 48→49, MCP 10→11 across CLAUDE.md / plugin.json /
  README / stats.json.

### Note

Stitch endpoint + tool names came from research that couldn't be fully adversarially verified (session
limit); the skill instructs verifying via `list tools` on first connect and degrades to the manual path if
the server is unreachable. Tracked as STORY-0033 open risk in `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

---

## [3.8.0-alpha.7] - 2026-06-10 (Model routing: prefer the session model)

> The plugin no longer hardcodes a stronger model (Opus) for "complex" work, nor pins substantive agents to Sonnet. It now **inherits the session model** by default — so a newer/stronger model the user launches flows through automatically, with no plugin update needed to "keep up." The only deliberate override is down-shifting to `haiku` for trivial mechanical work.

### Changed

- **`rules/core/small-to-large-routing.md` rewritten** — from a `Haiku→Sonnet→Opus` ladder with "start Opus for hard problems" to **"prefer the session model; down-shift to `haiku` only for trivial work; never force-upgrade to a named model."** The session model is the ceiling; there is no escalation to a hardcoded model. Defaults table: substantive agents → **inherit**; only the trivial detectors keep `haiku`.
- **`skills/agent-detector/SKILL.md` Model Selection** — was `Quick→haiku, Standard→sonnet (opus for architecture/design), Deep→sonnet (opus for planning)`; now Quick/classification → `haiku`, **everything else inherits the session model**.
- **Stripped per-agent `model:` overrides** so they inherit the session model: `strategist`, `tester`, `security`, `devops` (were `model: sonnet`), plus reasoning skills `problem-solving`, `sequential-thinking`. Deliberate `haiku` floors kept on `scanner`, `agent-detector`, `git-workflow`, `session-continuation`.
- **Reframed model-named guidance to be capability-based** (future-proof, no stale model names): `rules/core/context-management.md` compaction strategy now keys off **context-window size** (small/mid vs large) instead of Haiku/Sonnet/Opus; `rules/workflow/dual-llm-review.md` reviewer selection now matches the **session model tier** instead of naming Opus/Sonnet/Haiku.
- Doc sync: `agents/README.md` frontmatter schema + rules (omit `model:` to inherit; `haiku` only as a cheap floor), `rules/README.md` one-line description.

### Why

New model releases no longer require a plugin update to be used for complex work — the user's session model choice is the single source of truth. Removes the anti-pattern the routing rule itself warned against ("set a fixed model per agent regardless — breaks Opus-session users' intent").

---

## [3.8.0-alpha.6] - 2026-06-10 (Status line: rate-limit usage)

> The status line gains a usage line showing how much of the rate-limit budget is spent and when it resets — from the `rate_limits` object Claude Code provides on stdin.

### Added

- **`scripts/statusline.sh` usage line** — renders `⏳ 5h {pct}% ↻{reset} │ 7d {pct}% ↻{reset}` from `rate_limits.{five_hour,seven_day}.{used_percentage,resets_at}`. Percentage is color-coded by severity (**red ≥90 · yellow ≥70 · green** otherwise); reset times are formatted from epoch to local `HH:MM` (5h) / `Day HH:MM` (7d). Present only for Claude.ai subscribers after the session's first API response — **degrades silently** when `rate_limits` is absent (no line). Parses jq-first with a grep fallback (one-lines the JSON to read the nested object). Disable: `AF_STATUSLINE_USAGE=0`.

### Changed

- Status-line header comment "Format:" block + `aura-frog/CLAUDE.md` Status Line section document the new usage line and `AF_STATUSLINE_USAGE` flag.

---

## [3.8.0-alpha.5] - 2026-06-09 (Hotfix: botched findProjectRoot() migration)

> The v3.8.0-alpha.2 `findProjectRoot()` migration inserted `const { findProjectRoot } = require('./hook-runtime.cjs');` **inside an array literal** in 4 hook files, producing a `SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'const'`. The bug stayed latent while the installed plugin was 3.7.4; updating to the 3.8.0-alpha line surfaced it ("Failed with non-blocking status code: …/af-config-utils.cjs:498"). Any hook that `require()`d an affected lib failed to load.

### Fixed

- **`SyntaxError` in 4 hook files** — hoisted the lazy `require('./hook-runtime.cjs')` out of the array literal to a valid statement position (immediately before the array, preserving the lazy-require to avoid a circular dependency with `hook-runtime.cjs`):
  - `aura-frog/hooks/lib/af-config-utils.cjs` (`isAgentTeamsEnabled`, line 498) — `af-config-utils` is required by **12 hooks**, so this was the highest-impact instance.
  - `aura-frog/hooks/lib/record-workflow-event.cjs` (`getActiveWorkflowId`)
  - `aura-frog/hooks/lib/team-bridge.cjs` (`resolveWorkflowDir`)
  - `aura-frog/hooks/subagent-init.cjs` (workflow-state path resolution)
- Verified: `node -c` clean across **all** hooks + libs (0 syntax errors); each fixed module loads and `findProjectRoot()` resolves; full suite **627/627** green.

---

## [3.8.0-alpha.4] - 2026-06-08 (Multi-line status line)

> The status line (`scripts/statusline.sh`) now renders **multi-line** and owns the full output (dir/git prefix + AF context + opt-in cost), instead of emitting only the AF segment and relying on a user shim. Fixes single-line truncation on narrow terminals and lets the layout survive plugin upgrades.

### Added

- **`scripts/statusline.sh` now owns the full multi-line status line** (was: single AF segment only):
  - **Line 1** — `➜ {dir}  git:({branch}) {✓|✗N} {↑ahead} {↓behind}   🕐 HH:MM`. Working-tree state via `git status --porcelain` (✓ clean / ✗N changed-file count); ahead/behind via `git rev-list --left-right --count @{upstream}...HEAD` (shown only when non-zero). All git calls use `--no-optional-locks`, are guarded by an `is-inside-work-tree` probe (non-git cwd skips them entirely), and degrade silently (detached HEAD / no upstream).
  - **Lines 2–3** — the AF context line is split on ` │ ` (`🐸 AF v… │ {mode} {step} │ {agent}` then `{model} │ {ctx}% ctx`) so long lines no longer clip. The exact AF substring is preserved internally before the split.
  - **Line 4 (opt-in)** — `💰 ${cost} │ +{added}/-{removed} │ ⏱ {duration} │ cc {version}`, rendered **only** when `AF_STATUSLINE_COST=1` AND the cost data is present. Cost was pulled from the always-on line in v3.7.4 ("visual noise without per-call breakdown"); this re-adds it behind a flag. Added green / removed red, line dimmed; duration `Xh Ym` / `Xm Ys` / `Zs`.
  - Parses `workspace.current_dir` → `cwd` → `$PWD` for the dir; all fields via the existing grep/sed fallback so it runs **with or without jq**; always `exit 0`.

### Changed

- **`AF_STATUSLINE_COST=1`** — new env flag to opt into the session-metrics line (line 4).
- **Shims are now thin pass-throughs** — `aura-frog/scripts/statusline-shim.sh` (and the user-installed `~/.claude/statusline-command.sh`) no longer build the dir/git prefix themselves (that moved into the plugin); they just forward stdin to the plugin script. Prevents a doubled prefix.
- Status line header comment "Format:" + examples updated to the new layout.

---

## [3.8.0-alpha.3] - 2026-06-03 (Durable project-context persistence + cross-tool porter)

> Two features. **FEAT-008** makes persisted project context actually reusable across sessions so Claude stops re-scanning the codebase every time. **FEAT-009** ships a one-command porter that exports the universal layer to GitHub Copilot, Codex, and Cursor. All work is TDD'd; +44 new tests across 4 suites, full suite green.

### Added

- **FEAT-008 — Durable project-context persistence**
  - **`aura-frog/scripts/context-snapshot.cjs`** (NEW) — generates a single SHA-stamped `snapshot.md` under `.claude/project-contexts/<name>/` by running the long-dormant `repo-map-gen.sh` + `file-registry-gen.sh` + `architecture-gen.sh` generators (which existed but were never persisted here). Freshness API: `generateSnapshot`, `readSnapshotMeta`, `isSnapshotFresh`, `getSnapshotPath`. A snapshot is "fresh" (reusable, skip re-scan) only while git HEAD + content-hash are unchanged. CLI: `node aura-frog/scripts/context-snapshot.cjs`.
  - **`aura-frog/hooks/context-auto-refresh.cjs`** (NEW) — self-healing `Stop` hook (async, debounced 60s) that regenerates the snapshot when watched dirs change, so the next session always loads fresh context without a manual re-scan. Disable: `AF_CONTEXT_AUTO_REFRESH_DISABLED=true`.
  - **Session-start staleness banner** — `session-start.cjs` now reports whether the durable snapshot is FRESH (reuse, no re-scan) or STALE (refresh hint), on both fast-path and full-path. Disable: `AF_CONTEXT_STALE_BANNER_DISABLED=true`.
- **FEAT-009 — Cross-tool porter**
  - **`aura-frog/scripts/port-plugin.cjs`** (NEW) — exports the universal layer (CLAUDE.md + 71 rules + 56 skills + 15 agents + 24 commands + MCP) to other tools' native formats: `copilot` (`.github/copilot-instructions.md` + path-scoped `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`), `codex` (`AGENTS.md`), `cursor` (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`), or `all`. Writes a `PORT_MANIFEST.json` per run. CLI: `node aura-frog/scripts/port-plugin.cjs <target> [--out <dir>] [--dry-run]`.
  - **`aura-frog/scripts/PORT_USAGE.md`** (NEW) — porter usage guide; pairs with `docs/PORTABILITY.md`.

### Fixed

- **Cache invalidation never fired for non-JS projects** — `af-project-cache.cjs` keyed invalidation off a 24h TTL + a `KEY_FILES` list of JS/TS/Go/Python configs. For this markdown/bash/yaml plugin none of those exist, so the cache froze (observed: `project-detection.json` stuck at 2026-02-11 reporting 11 agents / 53 skills while reality was 15 / 56). Invalidation is now **project-type-aware** (content-hash of structural dirs — `agents/`, `skills/`, `rules/`, … — discovered at depth ≤2) **+ git-HEAD-sha**, the TTL is removed, and a `CACHE_SCHEMA_VERSION` bump rebuilds old-format caches. New exports: `getGitHead`, `calculateContentHash`, `resolveWatchMode`, `findStructuralDirs`, `getCacheStaleness`.
- **Ghost-dir cache miss** — `getProjectName()` preferred `package.json` `name` (`aura-frog-dev`) over the dir basename (`aura-frog`) where context actually lives, so the cache read/wrote a path that never matched the real data → permanent cache miss. Now an existing `.claude/project-contexts/<basename>/` wins.

### Changed

- **Hooks: 45 → 46** (added `context-auto-refresh.cjs`; wired into `hooks.json` `Stop`, async).
- **`jest.config.cjs`** — added `aura-frog/scripts/__tests__` to `roots`.
- Tests: **+44** — `af-project-cache.test.cjs` (17, NEW), `context-snapshot.test.cjs` (5, NEW), `context-auto-refresh.test.cjs` (8, NEW), `port-plugin.test.cjs` (74, NEW).

### Stats

- Hooks: **46** (was 45) · Scripts: +3 new files
- Agents 15 · Skills 56 · Rules 71 · Commands 24 · MCP 8 (unchanged)

## [3.8.0-alpha.2] - 2026-05-28 (CWD pollution fix — `findProjectRoot()` migration)

> Hotfix on top of v3.8.0-alpha. Closes the long-standing "stray `.claude/` folders in subdirs" bug. Every hook that wrote to `.claude/cache/` or `.claude/metrics/` was using `process.cwd()` blindly — when launched from a subdir (e.g., user did `cd aura-frog && claude-code`, or a PreToolUse hook fired during a Bash command with a transient `cd`-prefix), the hook created `<subdir>/.claude/` instead of `<root>/.claude/`. This commit ships the resolver + migrates 25 hook files + 3 shell scripts onto it.

### Added

- **`findProjectRoot()`** in `aura-frog/hooks/lib/hook-runtime.cjs` — walks up from a starting dir (default `process.cwd()`) looking for `.claude/` or `.git/` marker. Honors `AF_PROJECT_ROOT` env override. Falls back to start dir if no marker found.
- **6 new tests** in `aura-frog/hooks/lib/__tests__/hook-runtime.test.cjs` covering marker discovery (called from root, called from subdir, called from deeply nested dir), env override, and fallback semantics. Total now **99 tests** (was 93).

### Changed

- **25 hook files** migrated from `path.join(process.cwd(), '.claude', ...)` to `path.join(findProjectRoot(), '.claude', ...)`:
  - Hooks: `auto-learn`, `changelog-notify`, `compact-handoff`, `feedback-capture`, `jira-auto-fetch`, `json-toon-projector`, `mcp-call-gate`, `phase-checkpoint`, `pre-flight-validate`, `prompt-logger`, `session-metrics`, `session-reset-trigger`, `session-start`, `smart-learn`, `subagent-init`, `test-pattern-extractor`, `thinking-boost`, `token-tracker`, `update-check`, `workflow-edit-learn`
  - Lib: `af-config-utils`, `af-learning`, `af-memory-loader`, `record-workflow-event`, `team-bridge`
- **3 shell scripts** picked up an equivalent `find_project_root` bash function: `aura-frog/scripts/statusline.sh`, `aura-frog/scripts/dashboard.sh`, `aura-frog/scripts/project-refresh-incremental.sh`.
  - `statusline.sh` also now prefers the `cwd` field that Claude Code passes via stdin JSON.

### Fixed

- **Stray `.claude/` folders** in 8 locations: `aura-frog/.claude`, `aura-frog/{agents,commands,docs,docs/phases,rules,skills}/.claude`, `docs/.claude`. All caches were stale (March–May), regenerate on next session in the canonical `<root>/.claude/` location. **Bug class is closed** for any caller routed through the migrated surface — verified via smoke test (token-tracker invoked from `aura-frog/skills/` writes to root `.claude/cache/`, not to `aura-frog/skills/.claude/`).

### Stats diff

- Hook files modified: 25
- Shell scripts modified: 3
- Tests: 93 → 99 (+6)
- LOC change in hook-runtime.cjs: 653 → ~720 (added `findProjectRoot` + JSDoc)

### Migration / breaking changes

- **None.** All hooks gain a new helper import; existing behavior preserved (the resolver falls back to `process.cwd()` if no marker found, matching the legacy behavior).

---

## [3.8.0-alpha] - 2026-05-27 (v3.8 hook-runtime foundation — FEAT-007 / STORY-0009 / TASK-00023 only)

> First alpha cut of the v3.8 hook refactor. **This is a pre-release: only the foundation library lands here. The other three stories (STORY-0010 env-var drop, STORY-0011 SQLite WAL, STORY-0012 perf budget) remain pending.** Use to validate the lib in isolation before the rest of FEAT-007 ships.

### Added

- **`aura-frog/hooks/lib/hook-runtime.cjs`** (653 LOC) — unified runtime utilities for hook scripts. 6 functional exports + 5 error classes + 4 back-compat re-exports + 2 internal helpers (`validateSafePath` for CWE-22 path traversal defense, `deepFreeze` for CWE-471 immutability).
  - `readHookInput()` — strict stdin JSON parser; throws typed `HookInputSchemaError` on schema gap; does NOT touch `process.env` (no silent degrade for security gates per GH#7 finding).
  - `readHookInputCompat()` — lenient counterpart with `CLAUDE_*` env-var fallback + `tool → tool_name` alias for legacy hooks. Documented as lower-integrity trust boundary.
  - `appendAuditJsonl(path, row)` — locked NDJSON appender; cross-process safe via `fs.openSync(lockPath, 'wx')` (O_EXCL) + busy-wait exp backoff + PID-liveness stale reclaim. Lock timeout configurable via `HOOK_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS` env (default 2000ms).
  - `atomicWrite(path, content)` — write-then-rename atomic file write via `.tmp.<pid>.<6hex>` intermediate (48-bit entropy floor). Wraps fs errors in `HookIOError` preserving original message.
  - `logger(scope)` — NDJSON-on-stderr structured logger gated by `HOOK_LOG_LEVEL` env. Routes to fd 2 via `fs.writeSync` (never `process.stderr.write`; stdout reserved for hook JSON responses).
  - `safeExit(code, reason?)` — sync stderr record + `process.exit`; uses `fs.writeSync(2, ...)` for guaranteed flush before exit.
  - `withBudget(ms, fn, {label?})` — race `fn()` against a `setTimeout` budget; rejects `HookBudgetTimeout` on timeout with `.finally(clearTimeout)` cleanup + silent catch on workPromise (no unhandled rejection).
- **`aura-frog/hooks/lib/__tests__/hook-runtime.test.cjs`** (1238 LOC) — 93 jest tests covering all exports + 5 error classes + back-compat re-exports + module shape. Includes subprocess-based concurrent-write contention test (10 parallel workers).
- **GH #6 acceptance** — `hooks/lib/hook-runtime.cjs` exists with 6 documented exports + unit tests pass.

### Security hardening (Phase 4 review)

- **CWE-117 (Improper Output Neutralization for Logs):** newline-escape attacker-controlled bytes in `meta.raw` on `invalid_json` errors so downstream raw-stderr loggers cannot forge audit log lines.
- **CWE-471 (Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data):** `readHookInput` returns deep-frozen objects so nested `tool_input` / `tool_response` cannot be mutated between gate validation and tool dispatch.
- **CWE-22 (Path Traversal):** `validateSafePath` rejects `..` segments in `auditPath` / `targetPath` arguments.
- **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation):** `HOOK_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS` is clamped to `> 0`; negative / zero / non-finite values fall back to 2000ms default (was: `parseInt(env) || 2000` accepted `-1` as truthy → silent audit drop).
- **CWE-330 (Insufficient Randomness):** `atomicWrite` tmp suffix uses `crypto.randomBytes(6)` (48-bit entropy) — was 24-bit.
- **CWE-807 (Reliance on Untrusted Inputs):** `readHookInputCompat` JSDoc explicitly flags env-var fields as lower trust boundary; security-critical hooks MUST use strict `readHookInput`.
- **CWE-362 (Race Condition):** stale-lock reclaim race window documented (benign; `O_EXCL` ensures only one winner). STORY-0011 SQLite WAL eliminates this surface.
- **CWE-772 (Missing Release of Resource):** `withBudget` abandon semantics documented — callers must use RAII or AbortController for OS resources.
- **GH #21** — `installWatchdog` NDJSON migration deferred to STORY-0010.

### Changed

- **`jest.config.cjs`** — `roots` extended with `aura-frog/hooks/lib/__tests__` so co-located test files are discovered without moving them into `__tests__/` at repo root.

### Plan-tree state

- New feature: **FEAT-007 hook-runtime-v3.8** (planned → in_progress).
- New stories: **STORY-0009 (active), STORY-0010, STORY-0011, STORY-0012** (planned, DAG: 9 → 10/11/12).
- 5 new T4 tasks under STORY-0009; **TASK-00023 done**; TASK-00024 + TASK-00025 unblocked (parallelizable), TASK-00026 blocked on 24, TASK-00027 blocked on 25+26.
- All 8 plan-tree invariants pass (52 nodes).

### Stats diff

- Hooks lib: 4 → 5 files (added hook-runtime.cjs)
- Hook tests: +1 file, +93 tests
- LOC added: +1891 (impl 653 + tests 1238)

### Migration / breaking changes

- **None.** `hook-runtime.cjs` is purely additive. All 42 existing hooks continue using `safe-stdin.cjs` re-exports byte-for-byte. STORY-0010 begins the migration to `readHookInput` for security-critical hooks; STORY-0010's final task deletes `safe-stdin.cjs`.

## [3.7.4] - 2026-05-15 (Documentation cleanup — zero-feature, zero-runtime-change)

> Polish release before v3.8. Doc-only — no new features, no agents added, no skills added, no hook changes. Eliminates 122 stale command references that accumulated during the v3.6 → v3.7 transition, ships two new CI gates to prevent doc rot from recurring, and slims the README by 45%.

### Added

- **`aura-frog/scripts/ci/validate-docs-syntax.sh`** — CI guard against pre-v3.7 verb syntax. 18 BLOCKED_PATTERNS covering the `workflow:*`-prefixed lifecycle verbs, the old `agent:` / `bugfix:` / `learn:` / `project:` namespaces, and the removed phase-hook MD paths. Wired into the `validate` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Exits 0 on this branch.
- **`aura-frog/scripts/ci/validate-doc-maturity.sh`** — CI guard against doc frontmatter drift. Every `docs/**/*.md` (except `docs/showcase/`, `docs/specs/`) must carry `last_aligned_with` + `status` + `audience`. `status=current` docs warn at diff > 2 minor versions. Wired into CI right after `validate-docs-syntax`.
- **`scripts/audit/stale-cmd-check.sh`** — Broader audit tool for contributors. 3-pass detection (verb syntax · `/aura-frog:*` namespaced · backticked bare `/word`). Knows about Claude Code built-ins (`/clear` / `/compact` / `/plugin` / etc.). Modes: `--json` / `--count` / `--quiet`. Idempotent.
- **`scripts/migrate-doc-frontmatter.sh`** — One-shot backfill of frontmatter to all `docs/**/*.md`. Idempotent; per-directory defaults. Run once during v3.7.4.
- **`scripts/add-ai-banner.sh`** — One-shot inserter for the AI-consumed reference banner on `aura-frog/skills/*/SKILL.md` and `aura-frog/rules/**/*.md`. Idempotent.
- **`docs/getting-started/README.md`** — Single ordered entry index for first-time users (QUICKSTART → GET_STARTED → FIRST_WORKFLOW_TUTORIAL).
- **`docs/operations/INSTALLATION.md`** — Supplementary install paths (CLI symlink, manual install, `.envrc`, `.gitignore` hygiene) extracted from the old 472-line GET_STARTED.md.
- **`docs/README.md` "Source of Truth" section** — declares `docs/` canonical when in conflict with `aura-frog/`. 8-entry canonical-source table covering 5-phase TDD / OS model / 8 Pillars / agent selection / MCP / learning / security / installation.
- **AI-consumed banner** on every skill + rule file — 127 files (56 SKILL.md + 71 rule .md) gained a one-paragraph header pointing readers at `docs/architecture/HIERARCHICAL_PLANNING.md` / `docs/getting-started/`.

### Changed

- **`docs/getting-started/GET_STARTED.md` rewritten 472L → 148L.** Frontmatter + Prerequisites → Install → Your first workflow → What's next → Troubleshooting. v3.7.x syntax throughout; old `workflow:*` examples replaced with current `/run` + bare-verb syntax.
- **`README.md` slimmed 1294L → 720L (44% reduction).** 8 Pillars per-pillar deep-dives (568L total) collapsed to one-paragraph summaries (92L). Command Reference (103L) → single 8-row table (21L). Installation Optional Setup (43L) → 6-line bullet list pointing at INSTALLATION.md. Walkthrough / Why-Teams / Agent-Selection / Token-Budget already extraction-shape from prior cleanup; their destinations unchanged here.
- **`docs/reference/TESTING_GUIDE.md` syntax refresh** — 31 pre-v3.7 `workflow:*` references replaced; methodology framework preserved; `Last Updated` bumped to 2026-05-14; frontmatter added.
- **Bulk syntax sweep across 12 docs** — `docs/getting-started/QUICKSTART.md`, `docs/getting-started/FIRST_WORKFLOW_TUTORIAL.md`, `docs/operations/LEARNING_SYSTEM.md`, `docs/operations/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `docs/guides/AGENT_SELECTION_GUIDE.md`, `docs/architecture/{WORKFLOW_STATE_MANAGEMENT,WORKFLOW_DIAGRAMS,CONFIG_LOADING_ORDER,CLAUDE_FILE_ARCHITECTURE,MULTI_SESSION_ARCHITECTURE,os-architecture}.md`, `docs/getting-started/TOKEN_BUDGET.md`. ~80 individual `workflow:*` / `agent:list` / `bugfix:quick` / `learn:*` / `project:reload-env` references replaced with current syntax.
- **35 docs files gained frontmatter** (last_aligned_with + status + audience) via `migrate-doc-frontmatter.sh`. Per-dir status: getting-started=current, architecture=reference, guides=needs_review (9 docs flagged), operations=current, reference=reference, marketing/pre-v*=archive, marketing/other=current.
- **`docs/README.md` index restructured** — Getting Started section now points at the new entry index; Architecture section drops `overview.md` and labels `os-architecture.md` canonical.

### Moved (archived, history preserved)

- `docs/guides/USAGE_GUIDE.md` → `docs/marketing/USAGE_GUIDE.pre-v3.7.md` (`git mv`). Archive header points at QUICKSTART / FIRST_WORKFLOW_TUTORIAL / HIERARCHICAL_PLANNING. 21 stale refs went away by archive.
- `docs/architecture/overview.md` → `docs/marketing/overview.pre-v3.0.md` (`git mv`). Archive header points at os-architecture.md / HIERARCHICAL_PLANNING.md / aura-frog/CLAUDE.md / MCP_GUIDE.md / SECURITY_AND_TRUST.md. Pre-v3.0 content (Linear MCP, `.claude/logs/workflows/` paths) preserved for v2.x → v3.x audit.

### Removed

- Outdated install-time content from GET_STARTED.md (CLI install, manual install, env-var setup, learning-system intro, MCP intro, scripts intro, "how it works" rehash) — relocated to INSTALLATION.md or already covered in `docs/operations/{MCP_GUIDE,LEARNING_SYSTEM,SECURITY_AND_TRUST}.md`.
- README's per-pillar deep-dive sections (560 lines) — content moved to `docs/reference/BENEFITS.md Part 9`.

### Fixed

- 122 stale command references eliminated (116 caught by `validate-docs-syntax.sh`, 6 additional `/learn` bare-slash hits caught by the broader audit script).
- `docs/getting-started/TOKEN_BUDGET.md:24` — dropped stale `/run predict <task>` reference (command does not exist).
- `docs/operations/LEARNING_SYSTEM.md` `//af learn` double-slash artifact (introduced by sed sweep) corrected.

### CI

- Validate job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now runs 5 doc validators in sequence: `validate-toon` → `validate-config` → `validate-counts` → `check-broken-links` → `validate-readme-counts` → **`validate-docs-syntax`** (new) → **`validate-doc-maturity`** (new).

### Stats diff vs v3.7.3

- Agents: 15 (unchanged)
- Skills: 56 (unchanged) — all 56 SKILL.md files gained AI-consumed banner
- Rules: 71 (unchanged) — all 71 rule files gained AI-consumed banner
- Commands: 24 (unchanged)
- Hooks: 43 (unchanged)
- New scripts: 5 (`validate-docs-syntax.sh`, `validate-doc-maturity.sh`, `stale-cmd-check.sh`, `migrate-doc-frontmatter.sh`, `add-ai-banner.sh`)

### Plan tree (FEAT-006)

This release shipped as `FEAT-006 — Docs Cleanup & Reference-Integrity Sweep` under `INIT-001`. 8 stories: audit + decisions (STORY-0001), Phase A CI guard (STORY-0005), Phase B sweep + onboarding (STORY-0002), Phase C hierarchy consolidation (STORY-0003), Phase D README extraction (STORY-0006), Phase E maturity infrastructure (STORY-0007), Phase F AI/human boundary (STORY-0008), and close + version bump (this story — STORY-0004). All 19 T4 tasks closed in two sessions (audit / replan / Phase A + sweep / GET_STARTED / Phase C-F + close).

### Post-release follow-up — 2026-05-15 (per-step model tracking)

> Lands after the v3.7.4 doc-cleanup main release. No version bump. Pure observability addition — fail-open hooks, idle statusline output unchanged.

#### Added

- **`aura-frog/hooks/task-track-model.cjs`** — PreToolUse(Task) hook. Resolves the dispatched subagent's `model:` frontmatter, maps it to a short label (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6 → Sonnet 4.6`), and pushes a JSONL entry onto `.aura-frog/runtime/model-stack.jsonl`. Handles the `aura-frog:` plugin prefix; treats built-ins (Explore / general-purpose / Plan / statusline-setup) as silent no-ops.
- **`aura-frog/hooks/task-clear-model.cjs`** — PostToolUse(Task) hook. Pops the most-recent JSONL line; removes the file when the stack reaches zero. Atomic `write tmp → rename`.
- **`.aura-frog/runtime/.gitignore`** — gitignores `model-stack.jsonl` and similar transient runtime files; the .gitignore itself stays tracked.
- **`__tests__/hooks/task-track-model.test.cjs`** — jest, 41 tests covering pure helpers (model display mapping, frontmatter parse, prefix normalize, agent resolve, push/pop) + end-to-end `processPreToolUse` / `processPostToolUse`.
- **`aura-frog/docs/statusline-model-tracking.md`** — 80-line user explainer with ASCII diagram + disable + extend sections.

#### Changed

- **`aura-frog/scripts/statusline.sh`** — adds a `render_active()` block. When `.aura-frog/runtime/model-stack.jsonl` is non-empty, renders `🐸 AF v{ver} │ ▶ {phase} │ {step_model} ⏱{duration} │ session: {session_model} │ {ctx}% ctx`. When empty (or corrupted last line, or jq missing), falls through to the existing idle render byte-identically. Duration formatter handles `Ns` / `MmSSs` / `HhMMm`; UTC parsing fixed for macOS BSD `date`.
- **`aura-frog/hooks/hooks.json`** — registers both new hooks under `matcher: "Task"` (Pre + Post), async, `2>&1`. No other hook entries touched.

#### Stats diff (post-release)

- Hooks: 43 → **45** (+2)
- Tests: 368 → **409** (+41); all green; no regressions; lint clean on new files
- Version: 3.7.4 (unchanged)

## [3.7.3] - 2026-05-12 (Plan relocation + run linking + test-pyramid + statusline transparency)

> A consolidated release bundling six tightly-coupled shipments since v3.7.2:
>
> 1. **Plan storage restructure** — `.aura/plans/` → `.claude/plans/`, slug-aware folder schema, bidirectional run↔feature linking (PR #16).
> 2. **TTY-hang fix** — 14 hooks that called `fs.readFileSync(0)` could block forever when stdin is a TTY; now gated by `fstatSync(0)` via the new `hooks/lib/safe-stdin.cjs` helper, with Node 20/22 restored to the CI matrix (PR #17).
> 3. **README hygiene** — five stale counts corrected, 419 lines moved from `README.md` into `docs/*` (Walkthrough, Token Budget, Agent Selection, "Why Teams Ship Faster"), plus the new `validate-readme-counts.sh` CI guard (PR #18).
> 4. **Statusline transparency + agent announcements** — cost segment removed, `mode {step}` and `agent` surfaced from `run-state.json`, every phase/step dispatch must announce builder/reviewer/gate to the user (PR #19).
> 5. **E2E test-gap fix** — Phase 2 now picks the test layer (unit/integration/e2e) before writing, Playwright is the recommended e2e default with MCP integration, and UI/auth/payment tasks must add at least one e2e spec (PR #20).
> 6. **Skill-vs-Agent disambiguation** — fixes the `Agent type 'aura-frog:bugfix-quick' not found` error class by adding ⚠️ callouts in CLAUDE.md, commands, and SKILL files (also PR #4 skill review optimization upstream).

### Changed (storage layout)

- **Default plans dir: `.aura/plans/` → `.claude/plans/`.** Resolution order in scripts: explicit positional arg → `$AF_PLANS_DIR` env var → `.claude/plans/` (default) → `.aura/plans/` (legacy fallback, removed in v4.0).
- **Feature folder schema:** flat `features/FEAT-A.md` → folder `features/{ID}_{slug}/feature.md`. Same for stories (`stories/{ID}_{slug}/story.md`) and tasks (`tasks/{ID}_{slug}.md`). If a JIRA / Linear / GitHub ticket ID is attached, it's used as the prefix; otherwise the plan-orchestrator mints `FEAT-N` / `STORY-NNNN` / `TASK-NNNNN`.
- **`new-plan.sh`** writes a new `INDEX.md` on first init documenting the layout, naming convention, run-feature linking, commands, and migration path from the legacy location.

### Added (run ↔ feature linking)

- **`scripts/plans/link-run.sh`** — two-sided helper: writes `feature_id` + `feature_slug` + optional `anchor.task_id` to `run-state.json` AND appends an idempotent row to the feature's `## Runs` table. Subcommands: `link`, `unlink` (marks discarded, doesn't delete), `list`.
- **`run-state.json` gains `feature_id`, `feature_slug`, `feature_linked_at`** (and `anchor.task_id` when a specific T4 is anchored). Surfaces in `/run status` and `/run resume`.
- **`feature.md` gains a `## Runs` section** listing every `/run` invocation against the feature with status (in_progress / done / discarded) + start timestamp + anchor task. Auto-managed by `link-run.sh`.
- **`/run feature: FEAT-A <task>`** prefix anchors a new run to a feature. `run-orchestrator` Step 0c writes both sides of the link.
- **`/run resume <FEATURE_ID>`** lists runs under a feature and prompts to pick one (or auto-resumes the single in-progress run).
- **Phase 5 updates the link.** On finalize, `link-run.sh link <run-id> <feature> --status done` replaces the in-progress row.

### Helper functions in `_lib.sh`

- **`slugify <text>`** — lower-case ASCII kebab-slug, capped at 50 chars.
- **`feature_folder <id> <intent>`** — composes `{ID}_{slug}` for consistent folder naming.
- **`plans_dir [explicit]`** — 4-level resolution (arg → env → default → legacy fallback) replacing the old hardcoded `.aura/plans` default.

### Tests

- **+5 new unit tests in `plans.test.cjs`** covering `link-run.sh`: link writes both sides, idempotent re-link, list output, missing run-state refusal. Total plan-script tests now 43 (was 38).
- Existing 38 plan-script tests + 64 bare-word-router tests still green.

### Path sweep (35 files)

`.aura/plans/` → `.claude/plans/` (and `.aura/memory/` → `.claude/memory/`) across 8 agent files, 9 hooks, 12 skills, 7 rules, 11 command files, the dashboard script, and CLAUDE.md. `.aura/security/mcp-audit.jsonl` stays where it is — MCP audit is a separate concern from plans.

### Migration path

No automatic content migration — the script ships with this notice on first init:

```
ℹ Legacy .aura/plans/ detected. To migrate:
ℹ   mv .aura/plans .claude/plans
ℹ Or set AF_PLANS_DIR=.aura/plans to keep using the legacy location.
```

The legacy `.aura/plans/` fallback in `plans_dir()` is removed in v4.0.

### Deprecation timeline

- v3.7.3 (this release): `.claude/plans/` is the default. `.aura/plans/` works via fallback (with stderr warning).
- v4.0: `.aura/plans/` fallback removed. Must set `AF_PLANS_DIR=.aura/plans` to keep using the legacy location.

### Fixed — TTY hang in 14 hooks (PR #17)

- **Root cause** — `fs.readFileSync(0)` blocks indefinitely when stdin is an interactive terminal (no EOF arrives, no exception thrown). Symptom: Ubuntu Node 20/22 jobs in CI hung for 10+ minutes before the workflow timed out; locally the hook never returned.
- **`hooks/lib/safe-stdin.cjs`** — new helper that uses `fs.fstatSync(0)` to detect whether stdin is a pipe/FIFO. Returns the parsed JSON when piped; returns `null` immediately when stdin is a TTY. Synchronous, zero deps, ≤20 lines.
- **14 hooks swept** — every `readFileSync(0, 'utf8')` call in `hooks/*.cjs` replaced with `require('./lib/safe-stdin')()`. Hooks that need stdin (most `UserPromptSubmit` hooks) now no-op when invoked interactively instead of hanging.
- **CI matrix restored** — `.github/workflows/test.yml` re-adds Node 20.x + 22.x (removed in `027c2e0` while the hang was unexplained). Per-job SIGKILL timeout from `8a3fa1c` retained as belt-and-braces.

### Fixed — Stale counts + README cleanup (PR #18)

- **Five stale count references corrected** across `README.md` and `aura-frog/CLAUDE.md`: 55→56 skills, 70→71 rules, 42→43 hooks, 9→15 agents, 6→24 commands.
- **`scripts/ci/validate-readme-counts.sh`** — new CI guard with three surgical grep patterns (Markdown bold table cells, `[All Components (N)]` link labels, colon-aligned summaries) that scope the check tightly enough to avoid false positives on narrative prose. Wired into `.github/workflows/test.yml`.
- **README slimmed 1493 → 1074 lines (−419)** — four sections relocated to `docs/`:
  - "Walkthrough: Standard Path" → `docs/walkthrough/STANDARD_FLOW.md`
  - "Token Budget Reality" → `docs/guides/TOKEN_BUDGETS.md`
  - "Agent Selection" → `docs/guides/AGENT_SELECTION.md`
  - "Why Teams Ship Faster" → `docs/marketing/WHY_TEAMS_SHIP_FASTER.md`
- **Banner PNG preserved** — `assets/logo/github_banner.png` checksum unchanged; an accidental recompression during PR rebase was reverted before merge.

### Added — Statusline transparency + per-step agent announcements (PR #19)

- **New statusline format:** `🐸 AF v{version} │ {mode} {step} │ {agent} │ {model} │ {ctx}% ctx`
  - **mode** — read from `run-state.json#flow` (specific: `feature-deep`, `bugfix`, `refactor`, `test`, `security`, `review`, `deploy`, `quality`); falls back to `#complexity` (Quick/Standard/Deep/Project); `idle` when no in-progress run.
  - **step** — `P{N}` for 5-phase Deep runs (from `current_phase`); `S{N}` for bugfix's 4-step TDD (`current_step` ∈ `investigate`/`test-red`/`fix-green`/`verify`); omitted for quick/idle.
  - **agent** — `run-state.json#active_agent`, updated by run-orchestrator at every dispatch; falls back to last entry in `agents[]` array, then the session-start cache.
  - **cost segment removed** — Claude Code's `total_cost_usd` is real but adds visual noise without per-call breakdown. Use `/af status` for a richer cost+token report.
- **Mandatory builder/reviewer/gate announcements** — run-orchestrator must emit `─── Phase {N} · {Name} ─── Builder: {agent} · Reviewer: {agent}` at every phase boundary and `─── Step S{N} · {Name} ─── Dispatching {agent}…` at every bugfix step transition. Updates `run-state.json#active_agent` so the statusline reflects reality.

### Added — E2E test-gap fix (PR #20)

- **`skills/test-writer/SKILL.md#test-type-selection`** — new section forcing Phase 2 to decide unit vs integration vs e2e BEFORE writing. Trigger words requiring an e2e layer: `login`, `signup`, `checkout`, `payment`, `flow`, `journey`, `end-to-end`, `happy path`, `smoke test`, UI-bearing tasks, T2 features with user-visible acceptance criteria.
- **`skills/run-orchestrator/SKILL.md`** — Phase 2 now runs the test-type selection step explicitly. Cannot silently default to unit-only on UI/auth/payment tasks; must surface "no e2e runner detected — install playwright, use cypress, or `unit-only` to proceed" prompt when needed.
- **`agents/tester.md`** — adds "Test Pyramid (v3.7.4+) — pick the layer FIRST" section + `playwright` MCP usage guidance + runner-verification discipline (read pass/fail counts; "Tests passed" without a count = `0 tests collected` bug).
- **`skills/bugfix-quick/SKILL.md`** — Step 2 (Test RED) now includes "Pick the right layer" — UI / user-flow / auth / payment regressions get an e2e spec via Playwright MCP, not a unit test that won't actually reproduce it.

### Added — Skill-vs-Agent disambiguation

- **CLAUDE.md, `commands/run.md`, `skills/test-writer/SKILL.md`, `skills/bugfix-quick/SKILL.md`** — explicit ⚠️ callouts that `bugfix-quick`, `test-writer`, `run-orchestrator` etc. are **skills** (Skill tool), not **agents** (Agent tool). Calling them via `subagent_type: 'aura-frog:<name>'` errors with "Agent type not found". This fixes the most common new-user error class.

### Path sweep (35 files, expanded scope)

`.aura/plans/` → `.claude/plans/` (and `.aura/memory/` → `.claude/memory/`) across 8 agent files, 9 hooks, 12 skills, 7 rules, 11 command files, the dashboard script, and CLAUDE.md. `.aura/security/mcp-audit.jsonl` stays where it is — MCP audit is a separate concern from plans.

### Stats diff

|---|---:|---:|
| Agents | 15 | 15 |
| Skills | 56 | 56 |
| Rules | 70 | 71 (+test-pyramid section, no new rule file) |

## [3.7.2] - 2026-05-11 (Plan consolidation)

> Consolidates `/aura-frog:plan-*` (10 verbs) under a single dispatcher backed by the new `plan-orchestrator` skill. Ships the 9 backing scripts the existing command files always promised. Adds bare-word activation when a plan is active, plus `/run` intelligent escalation for project-scope tasks.

### Added

- **`skills/plan-orchestrator/SKILL.md`** — verb_table[11], intent_keywords[11], 3-stage routing pipeline (explicit verb → intent classifier → LLM fallback). Single owner of the plan-vocabulary dispatch.
- **`scripts/plans/_lib.sh`** — shared helpers (atomic write, get/set frontmatter, save_checkpoint, append_history, next_counter, bump_revision) with macOS BSD sed compatibility (Python fallback for JSON ops).
- **`scripts/plans/resolve-node.sh`** — node lookup: exact ID, lowercase normalisation, title-substring fallback, `--active`/`--feature`/`--story`/`--initiative` special tokens. Exit 0 single / 1 multi / 2 none.
- **9 new backing scripts** under `scripts/plans/` — `expand-node` (T1→T2→T3→T4 prep), `next-task` (pop next ready T4), `freeze-branch` (cascade-freeze descendants), `thaw-branch` (reverse freeze with conflict-resolution gate), `archive-feature` (compress completed T2+), `conflicts-scan` (list/show/resolve/history/check), `replan-node` (budget-aware), `promote-node` (bubble T4 discovery up), `undo-decision` (LIFO checkpoint restore).
- **`hooks/bare-word-router.cjs`** — UserPromptSubmit hook that fires only when `.aura/plans/active.json` exists. Routes verb-first prompts (≤5 words, first token ∈ 11-verb vocab) to `/aura-frog:plan <prompt>`. Async, ≤100ms cold-start, never blocks. Opt-out via `AF_BARE_WORD_ROUTER_DISABLED=true`.
- **`/run` intelligent escalation** — `rules/workflow/run-plan-bridge.md` extended to 8 triggers (added `word_count` weight 1 + `scope_verbs` weight 2). At weight ≥ 3 without an active plan, `run-orchestrator` Step 0 emits a 3-option prompt (`plan` / `deep` / `details`). On `plan`, writes `.claude/cache/pending-plan-bootstrap.json` with mission seed + feature seeds, then invokes `/aura-frog:plan`. Override prefixes: `/run task: <desc>`, `/run project: <desc>`. Opt-out: `AF_ESCALATION_DISABLED=true`.
- **`Project` complexity level** in `agent-detector` (only fires when bridge weight ≥ 3 + no plan; Quick/Standard/Deep classification unchanged otherwise).

### Updated

- **`commands/plan.md`** — rewritten as the single dispatcher. Documents 3-stage routing, power-user shortcuts, bare-word activation, override prefixes (`must do:` / `just do:` / `exactly:`), and the pending-plan-bootstrap.json consumption flow.
- **`commands/plan-{expand,next,status,replan,promote,archive,undo,freeze,thaw,conflicts}.md`** — collapsed to ~20-line alias stubs that delegate to `plan.md`. Each file documents the deprecation timeline (soft v3.7.2 → warning v4.0 → removed v5.0).
- **`commands/run.md`** — documents the new escalation step, override prefixes, and `AF_ESCALATION_DISABLED` env var.
- **`skills/run-orchestrator/SKILL.md`** — adds Step 0 (Escalation Check) before run-state creation (renamed Step 0b). Documents the `pending-plan-bootstrap.json` schema.

### Tests

- **`__tests__/scripts/plans.test.cjs`** — 38 unit tests against the 9 backing scripts + resolve-node.sh, using temp `.aura/plans/` fixtures. All scripts shelled out via spawnSync; assertions on observable file/JSON state.
- **`__tests__/hooks/bare-word-router.test.cjs`** — 64 tests (8 verbs × 3 cases each per the issue spec + override/plan-active/latency/crash recovery). 85% statements / 100% functions coverage. Imports via `require()` from production source (no test theater).
- Full suite: 255 + new tests pass; coverage gate unchanged at 25% floor.

### Stats diff

| | v3.7.1 | v3.7.2 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Skills | 55 | **56** (+plan-orchestrator) |
| Hooks | 42 | **43** (+bare-word-router) |
| Commands | 24 | 24 (alias stubs retained for backwards compat) |
| Backing scripts | 3 | **12** (resolve-node + _lib + 9 new) |
| Tests | 215 | **317** (+102 plan + bare-word) |

### Deprecation timeline

- `/aura-frog:plan-{expand,next,status,replan,promote,archive,undo,freeze,thaw,conflicts}` (10 aliases): **soft-deprecated v3.7.2**, warning emitted v4.0, removed v5.0. New users should prefer the consolidated `/aura-frog:plan <verb>` form. The bare-word activation (`next`, `expand FEAT-A`, etc.) works with both.

### Migration notes

- No breaking changes. Every legacy `/aura-frog:plan-<verb>` invocation continues to work via the alias stubs, which now delegate to the new backing scripts.
- Projects with `.aura/plans/active.json` will see the bare-word router suggest routes for verb-first prompts. To opt out: `export AF_BARE_WORD_ROUTER_DISABLED=true`.
- Multi-feature `/run` invocations will see the escalation prompt. To opt out per-session: `export AF_ESCALATION_DISABLED=true`. To force-bypass for one invocation: prefix with `task:` or `project:`.

### Documentation (catch-up)

- **README rewrite from v3.7.0 baseline** — Version badge bumped 3.7.0 → 3.7.2; "What's new" section restructured around the v3.7.2 plan consolidation + /run escalation + bare-word router (with a collapsed v3.7.0-highlights subsection for context). 8 Pillars status table updated (Tier 2 OPA / L3+L4 / auto-trigger moved from `v3.7.2+` to `v3.8+`). Command Reference section adds the consolidated `/aura-frog:plan <verb>` form. The Numbers table reflects updated counts. New "Honest Maturity Report" section discloses tech debt with references to issues #6/#7/#8/#9.
- **MIGRATION_TO_V3.7.md** — v3.7.2 changes prepended at the top (consolidation + bare-word + escalation), keeping the v3.7.0 historical section intact below for users still on v3.6.x.
- **LICENSE** — repo was missing the LICENSE file referenced in README. MIT license added.
- **Pre-rewrite README backup** — preserved at `docs/marketing/README.pre-v3.7.2-rewrite.md`.

---

## [3.7.1] - 2026-05-11 (CI stabilization)

> **Patch release.** An external senior review pulled HEAD post-v3.7.0 and found CI was red — the `|| true` masks we removed in v3.7.0 polish exposed three pre-existing script bugs and one ESLint v9 break. v3.7.1 closes them so CI is green on `main` and contributor PRs don't fail spurious checks. Zero behavioural change to runtime; this is plumbing.

### Fixed

- **`validate-toon.sh` exits cleanly under `set -e`** — nine occurrences of `((var++))` rewritten as `var=$((var+1))`. `((expr))` returns exit code based on the *evaluated* value, so post-incrementing from 0 returned 1 → `set -e` aborted silent. Counters survived in a subshell when the `find | while` pattern was used — rewrote as `while … < <(find …)` so `FILES_CHECKED` / `ERRORS` propagate. Default target is now `aura-frog/` instead of `.` (skips `node_modules/`, `.claude/`, `.aura/`, `.git/`, `coverage/`). Result: 221 files scanned, 0 errors locally.
- **`validate-config.sh` skips when file absent** — `ccpm-config.yaml` only exists in user projects, never in the plugin repo. Previously hard-failed; now exits 0 with an informational "skipping (normal for the plugin repo)" message. Still fails properly when the file exists and is malformed.
- **ESLint v9 flat config migration** — `.eslintrc.cjs` (legacy format, deprecated in v9.0) replaced with `eslint.config.js`. `package.json#scripts.lint` drops the `--ext .cjs` flag (no longer supported in flat config). Rule set unchanged. `npm run lint` now exits 0 with 93 informational warnings, 0 errors.
- **`generate-stats.sh` emits object form for `mcpServers`** — was hardcoded `"mcpServers": 6` which got out of sync with the `{total: 8, enabled: 6}` schema we standardised on. Now grep-counts entries + `disabled: true` flags in `.mcp.json` and emits the object. Regex fix: `[a-z0-9_-]` (includes digit + underscore) so `context7` doesn't get missed.
- **TOON drift across 6 files** — exposed once `validate-toon.sh` actually ran: `hooks[28]` → `[29]`, `scripts[26]` → `[34]`, `signals[4]` → `[5]`, `final_plan[8]` → `[9]`, `per_server[6]` → `[8]`, `patterns[12]` → `[7]`. Multi-table-in-one-fence patterns (which the validator's state machine doesn't handle) split into separate fences in `execution-rules.md`, `theme-consistency.md`, `mcp-response-logging.md`.
- **Forward-version markers** — `v3.7.1+` queued labels updated to `v3.7.2+` (since v3.7.1 *is* this release; Tier 2 OPA + L3/L4 LLM conflict + auto-trigger self-heal are queued for v3.7.2+).

### Verified locally — all 5 CI steps green

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| `validate-toon.sh` | exit 0 · 221 files · 0 errors |
| `validate-config.sh` | exit 0 (skipped — file absent, normal) |
| `validate-counts.sh` | exit 0 · all counts match |
| `npm run lint` | exit 0 · 93 warnings · 0 errors |
| `npm test -- --coverage` | exit 0 · 215 tests · coverage above threshold |

## [3.7.0] - 2026-05-11 (Stable — Marketplace Publish)

> **First stable release of the v3.7.0 hierarchical-planning track.** All 5 milestones (A-E) shipped through 7 internal pre-releases (alpha.1, alpha.2, alpha.3, alpha.4, beta.1, beta.2, rc.1). This is the marketplace publish.

### Headline

**A planning-first LLM OS for software engineering.** Plans persist across sessions; every Claude decision is forensically reproducible; conflicts are detected before silent overwrites; backward-compatible — your existing `/run` workflow continues unchanged.

### 🐸 The 8 Pillars (feature highlights)

v3.7.0 lands eight composable features organized into four themes. Full marketing breakdown in [README.md § The 8 Pillars](../../README.md#-the-8-pillars-of-the-planning-first-llm-os) and engineering depth in [BENEFITS.md Part 9](BENEFITS.md#part-9--the-8-pillars-of-the-planning-first-llm-os-v370).

| # | Pillar | Status | What it solves |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Hierarchical Planning** | ✅ | Plans survive session reset · `/compact` · machine restart |
| 2 | **Reasoning Trace Audit** | ✅ | Hallucinations caught before they ship (sha256-anchored evidence) |
| 3 | **Semantic Session Reset** | ✅ | Distill an Epic into permanent memory, then reset cleanly |
| 4 | **Pre-flight Validation** | ✅ Tier 1 · 🚧 Tier 2 OPA | Block bad AI output before it hits disk |
| 5 | **Semantic Conflict Detection** | ✅ L1+L2 · 🚧 L3+L4 LLM | Prevent silent overwrites between parallel tasks |
| 6 | **Self-Healing Orchestrator** | ✅ manual · 🚧 auto-trigger | Auto-diagnose F2/F3 failures; propose patches, never auto-apply |
| 7 | **MCP Security Layer** | ✅ | Per-agent allowlist + audit + rate limits for external integrations |
| 8 | **Phase-Role Binding** | ✅ | Phase 4 reviewer MUST differ from Phase 3 builder (Generator ≠ Evaluator) |

Each pillar is independently disable-able via env var. See *Disable mechanisms* section below.

### Stats (v3.6.1 → v3.7.0)

| Component | v3.6.1 | v3.7.0 | Delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Agents | 9 | **15** | +6 |
| Skills | 44 | **55** | +11 |
| Auto-invoke skills | 5 | **9** | +4 |
| Rules | 57 | **70** | +13 |
| Commands | 6 | **24** | +18 |
| Hooks | 28 | **42** | +14 |
| MCP servers | 6 | **8** | +2 |
| Scripts | ~43 | **55** | +12 |

### What shipped (across the 7 internal pre-releases)

- **alpha.1** — Hierarchical planning foundation: T0-T4 schema, plan-loader (auto-invoke), `master-planner` / `feature-architect` / `story-planner` agents, 8 planning commands, plan-tree validator with 8 invariants, byte-identical round-trip
- **alpha.2** — Failure handling + reasoning trace: F1-F5 deterministic classifier, `replanner` agent, `reasoning-trace-recorder` (auto-invoke), `/aura-frog:trace` with hallucination surface, grounding-discipline rule, checkpoint discipline + `/aura-frog:plan-undo` with git_sha rollback
- **alpha.3** — Project-level extension creation: `extension-detector` (auto-invoke), `/aura-frog:extend` command, `extension-policy` rule — auto-detect when a new skill/rule/command would help, confirm with user, create at `.claude/` (NEVER plugin-level)
- **alpha.4** — Memory tier: `epic-summarizer` agent (T2 done → permanent_memory), `permanent-memory-loader` (auto-invoke, ≤120 tokens), `plan-archivist`, `/aura-frog:reset-session`. **Plus: deterministic JSON→TOON projection hook** (saves tokens vs. AI-side projection rule)
- **beta.1** — Pre-flight Tier 1: 7 bash linters (frontmatter, tool-input, tool-output, path-safety, command-allowlist, secret-patterns, run-all), `pre-flight-validate.cjs` hook (blocks `rm -rf /`, hostile paths, credential leaks), single-use bypass with `/aura-frog:preflight bypass`
- **beta.2** — Conflict detection + freeze: L1 (file overlap) + L2 (function overlap) bash detectors, `conflict-arbiter` agent, F6 class, 3 conflict commands (`/aura-frog:plan-freeze`, `:thaw`, `:conflicts`), branch freeze cascade (descendants only per spec §13.1)
- **rc.1** — Self-healing + MCP security: `self-healing-orchestrator` (F2/F3 only, ≥0.7 confidence, NEVER auto-applies), `mcp-call-gate.cjs` (per-agent allowlist, rate limits, sanitized audit), `db-access-policy` + `mcp-security-policy` rules, Phase 4 ≠ Phase 3 builder HARD RULE, `/aura-frog:dashboard`

### Stable polish (this release)

- **MCP allowlists on all 9 baseline agents** (security=[], scanner=[], lead=[], strategist=[context7], devops=[firebase,slack], tester=[vitest,playwright], frontend=[context7,figma,playwright], mobile=[context7,figma,playwright], architect=[context7,postgres,redis]) — gate now actually enforces, not just defaulted to backward-compat
- **README rewrite** — lead with `/aura-frog:plan` + v3.7.0 systems overview; `/run` documented as lightweight mode for one-off tasks
- **`MIGRATION_TO_V3.7.md`** — single comprehensive migration doc: what's new, what's backward-compat, opt-in features, breaking-ish changes, env var inventory, deferred work
- Version files bumped 3.7.0-rc.1 → **3.7.0**

### Backward compatibility (per spec §2 — MINOR bump)

- `/run <task>` works exactly as before
- Existing 9 agents continue to work (now with explicit `mcp_servers:` allowlists)
- Existing 6 commands unchanged
- 5-phase TDD workflow preserved (now maps to T3 Story lifecycle when planning is active)
- `.envrc` env vars all preserved; new ones added (see migration guide)
- `.mcp.json` schema preserved; 2 new servers added (postgres, redis) both `disabled: true` by default
- All existing skills/rules/hooks preserved

### Disable mechanisms (every new feature has one)

```
AF_SELF_HEAL_DISABLED=true       — disable self-healing
AF_MCP_AUDIT_DISABLED=true       — disable MCP audit log (still enforces)
AF_TRACE_DISABLED=true            — disable reasoning trace
AF_PREFLIGHT_DISABLED=true        — disable pre-flight (strongly discouraged)
AF_CONFLICT_LLM_DISABLED=true     — already off in rc.1 (L3/L4 stubs)
AF_JSON_TOON_DISABLED=true        — revert to raw JSON in context
```

### Fixed (deliverable scaffolding — 2026-05-11)

Real user-reported gap: `/run` created `run-state.json` but never materialised the per-phase markdown deliverables the `workflow-deliverables.md` rule requires (REQUIREMENTS.md, TECH_SPEC.md, TEST_PLAN.md, etc.). Run dirs were empty except for run-state.json — the orchestrator's `deliverables[]` array tracked metadata but no actual .md files hit disk.

- **NEW `aura-frog/scripts/workflow/scaffold-phase-deliverables.sh`** — idempotent script. `bash scaffold-phase-deliverables.sh <run-id> <phase|all>` creates the phase's markdown skeletons from `aura-frog/templates/` (or a minimal frontmatter+sections fallback). Phase 1 → REQUIREMENTS / TECH_SPEC / TECH_SPEC_CONFLUENCE / DESIGN_DECISIONS. Phase 2 → TEST_PLAN / TEST_CASES. Phase 3 → IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES / FILES_CHANGED. Phase 4 → CODE_REVIEW / REFACTOR_LOG. Phase 5 → QA_REPORT / IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY / CHANGELOG_ENTRY. Total 13 files / 5 phases.
- **5 new templates added** to bring template count 15 → **20**: `code-review.md`, `qa-report.md`, `changelog-entry.md`, `implementation-notes.md`, `files-changed.md` (frontmatter + section headers + TODO markers, ready to fill in).
- **run-orchestrator/SKILL.md gets Step 0.5** — runs the scaffold after run-state.json is written (Phase 1) and on every phase transition. Skip for Quick/direct-edit runs only.
- **workflow-deliverables.md rule** updated with the new scaffold workflow + backfill instructions for pre-v3.7.1 runs.
- **3 existing runs in this repo backfilled** (`cleanup-260511`, `review-fix-260511`, `marketing-doc-260511`) — each now has 14 files (run-state.json + 13 phase deliverables) vs. the pre-fix 1 file.
- **Idempotent** — running the scaffold twice on the same phase prints "0 added", so it's safe to call on phase re-entry / resume / modify / reject without trashing user content.

### Fixed (re-review polish — 2026-05-11, ~4h after first patch batch)

A second senior review pulled the post-fix tree and flagged 7 remaining findings (1 hot: test theater; 2 cold; 4 polish). This commit closes the highest-ROI ones.

- **Test theater killed.** All 6 hook tests (`scout-block`, `prompt-reminder`, `scope-drift`, `security-scan`, `smart-learn`, `token-tracker`) now `require()` the production hooks directly instead of re-declaring the functions inline. Each hook source got a `if (require.main === module) main(); else module.exports = {...};` guard so `main()` only runs when the file is invoked as a script. Verified end-to-end: `npx jest --coverage` reports **31.76% statement coverage** across the 6 hooks (was **0%** before — review's #1 concern). 215 tests pass against real source.
- **Coverage gate in CI.** `jest.config.cjs` gains `coverageThreshold` (statements 25 / branches 20 / functions 40 / lines 25 — set as no-regression floor at current measured level). `ci.yml` now runs `npm test -- --coverage` so the threshold gates builds. As more hooks get tests (issue [#5](https://github.com/nguyenthienthanh/aura-frog/issues/5)), the floor ratchets up toward the senior review's 60% target.
- **`tool-call-tracer` real O(1) fix.** Replaced the half-measure in-memory counter (which the reviewer correctly identified as a per-invocation cache, not an actual O(n²) fix because each hook is a fresh Node process) with a sibling `.aura/plans/traces/{TASK_ID}.count` file. Atomic write via tmp+rename. Each event reads 4 bytes, not the full trace. True O(1) per event over a task lifetime.
- **`mcp-call-gate` no longer fails open silently when agent identity is unknown.** Order: stdin JSON `data.agent / data.agent_name / data.subagent_type` → `CLAUDE_AGENT_NAME` env var → fallback `'main'` (backward-compat). When BOTH stdin and env are absent, a one-time stderr warning is emitted (`.claude/logs/.mcp-agent-hint-shown` flag-file prevents spam) so admins notice the gate is in allow-all mode rather than mistakenly trusting the "per-agent security" claim. Smoke-tested: stdin `{"agent":"architect"}` against a non-allowlisted MCP blocks correctly.
- **`hooks.json` duplicate `"async": true`** on the lint-autofix entry — removed. Caused by an earlier copy-paste; JSON.parse tolerated it but it signalled missing linter discipline.
- **`stats.json` mcpServers semantic** — changed from scalar `6` (enabled-only) to `{ total: 8, enabled: 6 }` so the same number doesn't mean two different things across `stats.json` and `CLAUDE.md`/manifest.

### Security (post-release polish — 2026-05-11)

- **`.envrc` trust gate (HIGH-severity fix)** — closes the auto-source-of-untrusted-file finding from the senior review. New helper `aura-frog/scripts/envrc-guarded-source.sh` only sources `$PWD/.envrc` when its sha256 matches an entry in `~/.config/aura-frog/envrc-trust.json`. All 8 inline `if [ -f .envrc ]; then set -a; source .envrc; …; fi` hook commands in `hooks.json` now call the gate. New CLI: `af envrc allow|revoke|status|list`. Tampering with a previously-trusted `.envrc` invalidates the trust (hash mismatch → skip). Opt-out for legacy behavior: `AF_ENVRC_UNSAFE_AUTO_SOURCE=true`. `af doctor` surfaces the trust state. Verified end-to-end: untrusted .envrc skipped, approved .envrc sourced, tampered .envrc re-skipped.
- **`escapeShellValue` backtick escape (HIGH-severity fix)** — env-file values now escape backticks, closing the path where a git branch/remote URL containing backticks would survive double-quote shell escape and command-substitute on next source. Verified: `feat/test\`curl evil\`` → `feat/test\\\`curl evil\\\``.

### Added (post-release polish — 2026-05-11)

- **Run ↔ Plan bridge** — `/aura-frog:run` now auto-anchors to the active T4 task when `.aura/plans/active.json#active.task` is set; deliverables sync back to the plan tree on Phase 5. If a Feature is active but no task is claimed, suggests `/aura-frog:plan-next`. If no plan exists and the task description hits multi-feature/epic/shipping heuristics (escalation weight ≥ 3 across 6 signals), suggests `/aura-frog:plan` bootstrap first. Reverse direction: `/aura-frog:plan-next` surfaces a `/aura-frog:run` hint when it claims a task. Force modes (`must do:`, `just do:`, `exactly:`) skip the bridge; disable globally with `AF_RUN_PLAN_BRIDGE_DISABLED=true`. New rule: `rules/workflow/run-plan-bridge.md`. Updates: `skills/run-orchestrator/SKILL.md` Phase 1 setup, `commands/run.md` protocol, `commands/plan-next.md` output template. Rule count 70 → **71** (workflow 29 → 30).

### Fixed (post-release polish — 2026-05-11)

- **Command namespace consistency** — renamed 18 `aura-*.md` command files to drop the redundant `aura-` prefix; the slash form was displaying as `/aura-frog:aura-plan` (plugin prefix + filename redundancy). New slash forms match the core `/aura-frog:run` convention: `/aura-frog:plan`, `/aura-frog:plan-expand`, `/aura-frog:trace`, `/aura-frog:heal`, `/aura-frog:mcp`, `/aura-frog:dashboard`, `/aura-frog:extend`, `/aura-frog:preflight`, `/aura-frog:reset-session`, plus 10 `plan-*` subcommands. Updated ~140 references across docs, agents, hooks, rules, scripts, READMEs to long-form (e.g. `/aura:plan:expand` → `/aura-frog:plan-expand`). `git mv` preserved history. Audit clean.
- **Doc count drift** — synced stale v3.6.x counts in `README.md` (L101 / L533 / L697-700 / L708 / L1011-1019), `CONTRIBUTING.md` (project-structure block), `docs/README.md` (Plugin Internals list), `docs/reference/BENEFITS.md` (§4.3, §5.1, §6.1, §7.x) to v3.7.0 reality (15 / 55 / 70 / 24 / 42)
- **`install.sh` removed** — deprecated since v3.6 marketplace publish; only historical reference retained in this changelog. Use `/plugin install aura-frog@aurafrog` instead.
- **`scripts/jira-fetch.sh` removed** — `hooks/jira-auto-fetch.cjs` already calls the JIRA REST API directly (verified end-to-end against `IGNT-1975` on `fwdnextgen.atlassian.net`), so the standalone CLI script duplicated logic with no callers. Hook is now the single source of truth for JIRA fetching. Updated refs in `scripts/README.md`, `rules/workflow/mcp-response-logging.md`, `docs/operations/MCP_GUIDE.md`, `docs/getting-started/GET_STARTED.md`. Confluence fetch script kept (no equivalent hook). README gains a "JIRA Ticket Auto-Fetch" entry in the *More features* section.
- **`evaluate-prompts.cjs` refresh** — version-agnostic comments for command/agent surface; `AVAILABLE_AGENTS` array updated for the 15-agent roster (added master-planner, feature-architect, story-planner, replanner, epic-summarizer, conflict-arbiter); `AVAILABLE_COMMAND_CATEGORIES` adds `aura` namespace; `AVAILABLE_SKILLS` extended with auto-invoke planners + hierarchical-planning/safety skills
- **Audit clean** — zero orphan rules, zero dead markdown links, all 55 skills carry `user-invocable: false`

### Deferred (will land in v3.7.x patch releases — NOT blockers)

- L3 (semantic LLM) + L4 (architectural LLM) full implementations + `conflict_cache.jsonl` LRU
- Pre-flight Tier 2 (OPA, optional) — `install-opa.sh` + 5 default Rego policies
- 30+20+15+10 conflict fixture suites for L1-L4 acceptance corpus per spec §28.7
- FEAT-B fixture suites: classifier 80-suite + hallucination 20 + logic-error 15 + deviation_score auto-update + trace-event latency benchmark
- 16 remaining spec §30 docs (architecture/HIERARCHICAL_PLANNING, MASTER_PLANNER, 8 guides, 3 troubleshooting) — covered in summary form by `MIGRATION_TO_V3.7.md`; standalone files in v3.7.2+

### Verification

- `validate-counts.sh`: 15 / 55 / 70 / 24 / 42 — all OK
- `validate-plan-tree.sh`: 7 nodes · 8/8 invariants (all 5 milestones ✓)
- Reference integrity: zero orphans
- Allowlist enforcement: confirmed `security` agent now blocked from `postgres` MCP (rc=2)
- Sanitizer: AWS keys / GitHub PATs / OpenAI keys / Bearer tokens all redacted
- Rate limit: 30/min hard block fires at 30th call (stress-tested)

## [3.7.0-rc.1] - 2026-05-07 (Milestone E — Self-Healing + MCP Security + Dashboard)

> Final internal pre-release. All 5 milestones (A-E) complete. Next ship target is v3.7.0 stable (marketplace publish).

### Added — Self-healing safety gates + MCP security tier + phase-role hard rule + CLI dashboard

**Skills (2 new — 53 → 55)**
- `skills/self-healing-orchestrator/` — F2/F3 ONLY (refuses F1/F4-F6). Confidence ≥0.7 required to propose; below threshold escalates raw findings. NEVER auto-applies; user approval mandatory. Counts toward replan_budget. Per-task max 1; session cap 5. Disable via `AF_SELF_HEAL_DISABLED=true` env or `/aura-frog:heal disable` (session flag). Cross-checks ONLY context7 + permanent_memory + traces — no random web sources.
- `skills/mcp-security-auditor/` — read-side companion to `mcp-call-gate` hook. Reads `.aura/security/mcp-audit.jsonl`, projects to TOON via `json-to-toon.cjs`, surfaces blocked calls / rate-limit hits / suspicious patterns.

**Commands (3 new — 21 → 24)**
- `/aura-frog:heal diagnose|status|disable|enable|accept|decline` — self-healing orchestration. `accept <HEAL-ID>` applies a proposal as a NEW T4 task (not in-place patch). Bypass-counter + cycle-guard hardening.
- `/aura-frog:mcp status|audit|reset-limits|test` — MCP security operations. `audit --blocked-only` for forensics. `reset-limits` is logged event. `test <server>` is single-call connectivity check.
- `/aura-frog:dashboard` — terse one-screen CLI status (plan tree, active task, conflicts, memory, MCP, pre-flight). `--live` (5s refresh), `--json` (machine-readable, sanitized), `--section <name>` for slot integration.

**Rules (2 new agent-tier — workflow 29 unchanged; agent 17 → 19)**
- `rules/agent/db-access-policy.md` — DB MCPs locked down: architect + tdd-engineer only (default-deny for everyone else). Read-only by default; writes require explicit `--allow-write`. Destructive ops (DROP/TRUNCATE/DELETE without WHERE) HARD-BLOCKED unconditionally regardless of allowlist.
- `rules/agent/mcp-security-policy.md` — broader MCP framework: per-agent `mcp_servers:` allowlist (default = all backward-compat), sanitized audit log (Authorization stripped, tokens redacted), rate limits (soft 80% warn / hard 100% block), retention (`AF_MCP_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS=30` default).

**Rule update**
- `rules/workflow/plan-lifecycle.md` — Phase-Role binding promoted from advisory to **HARD RULE** (per spec §24, decision Q17). Phase 4 reviewer MUST NOT be the same agent as Phase 3 builder. Run-orchestrator refuses dispatch on violation; falls back to next-best reviewer; blocks phase transition if no eligible reviewer remains. Generator/Evaluator separation per Anthropic harness research.

**Hooks (1 new — 41 → 42)**
- `hooks/mcp-call-gate.cjs` — PreToolUse on `mcp__.*`. Parses `mcp__plugin_<plugin>_<server>__<method>` tool names. Enforces per-agent allowlist (reads `mcp_servers:` from agent frontmatter; null = backward-compat default of all-allowed). Tracks per-server per-session counters in `.claude/logs/.mcp-rate-counter.json`. Rate limit thresholds: soft 80% warn, hard 100% block. Runs `scripts/security/sanitize-mcp-input.sh` before audit append.

**Scripts (2 new)**
- `scripts/security/sanitize-mcp-input.sh` — strips Authorization headers, redacts AWS/GitHub/OpenAI/JWT/Bearer tokens, truncates >1KB strings. jq-based when available; sed-fallback otherwise.
- `scripts/dashboard.sh` — implementation behind `/aura-frog:dashboard`. Static / `--live` (5s loop) / `--json` / `--section` modes. Read-only — never mutates state.

**Config**
- `.mcp.json` — added `postgres` + `redis` servers (both `disabled: true` by default per spec §14.1, decision Q14 — opt-in for security)
- `plugin.json` — added `mcp_rate_limits` block with per-server overrides + `default` fallback (per spec §14.2)

### Acceptance criteria — rc.1 sub-scope

- [x] Self-healing only triggers F2/F3 (hard-coded refusal in skill body for F1/F4-F6)
- [x] Confidence < 0.7 escalates raw findings, doesn't propose
- [x] User approval required before patch applied (NEVER auto-applies — verified by skill spec)
- [x] Self-heal counts toward replan_budget
- [x] Per-agent MCP allowlist enforced by mcp-call-gate.cjs (allowlist parsed from agent frontmatter)
- [x] MCP audit log captures all calls with sanitization (smoke-tested with AWS key + GitHub PAT + Authorization header redaction)
- [x] Rate limits enforced (soft 80% warn + hard 100% block) — verified with 35-call stress test
- [x] Postgres MCP destructive ops blocked unconditionally (per `db-access-policy.md`)
- [x] AF_SELF_HEAL_DISABLED=true disables self-healing
- [x] Phase 4 reviewer ≠ Phase 3 builder formalized as HARD RULE in plan-lifecycle.md
- [x] /aura-frog:dashboard renders without errors (static + JSON modes verified)

### Verification

- `validate-counts.sh`: 15 / 55 / 70 / 24 / 42 — all OK
- `validate-plan-tree.sh`: 7 nodes · 8/8 invariants
- Reference integrity: zero orphans
- mcp-call-gate smoke tests: allowlist enforcement (rc 2 on violation), rate limit (35-call stress hits hard block correctly), sanitizer (AWS keys + GitHub PATs + Bearer tokens redacted in audit log)
- Dashboard: static + JSON modes both render cleanly

### Stats (v3.7.0-beta.2 → v3.7.0-rc.1)

- Agents: 15 (unchanged)
- Skills: 53 → **55** (+2: self-healing-orchestrator, mcp-security-auditor); auto-invoke 9 (unchanged)
- Rules: 68 → **70** (+2 agent-tier: db-access-policy, mcp-security-policy); workflow 29 unchanged but plan-lifecycle.md hard-rule promotion
- Commands: 21 → **24** (+3: /aura-frog:heal, /aura-frog:mcp, /aura-frog:dashboard)
- Hooks: 41 → **42** (+1 mcp-call-gate)
- Scripts: 52 → **55** (+3: sanitize-mcp-input + dashboard + get-plugin-prefix)
- MCP servers: 6 → **8** (+2 disabled: postgres, redis)

### Pending for v3.7.0 stable (final ship)

- 17 documentation deliverables per spec §30 (architecture/HIERARCHICAL_PLANNING, MASTER_PLANNER, llm-os update, 8 guides, 3 troubleshooting, MIGRATION_TO_V3.7)
- README.md update — lead with `/aura-frog:plan`, document `/run` as lightweight mode
- Marketplace listing update with v3.7.0 description
- Public release announcement
- Add `mcp_servers:` allowlists to existing 9 baseline agents (gate works but most currently default to all-allowed)

### Pending — deferred (will land in v3.7.x patch releases or as opt-in features)

- L3 (semantic LLM) + L4 (architectural LLM) full implementations + conflict_cache.jsonl LRU
- 30+20+15+10 conflict fixture suites for L1-L4 acceptance corpus

- FEAT-B deferred fixtures: classifier 80-suite + hallucination 20 + logic-error 15 + deviation_score auto-update + trace-event latency benchmark

## [3.7.0-beta.2] - 2026-05-07 (Milestone D — Conflict Detection + Freeze)

> Internal pre-release tag. Not published to marketplace. Ships L1+L2 conflict detection (deterministic bash, fast), freeze cascade, conflict-arbiter agent, F6 failure class, 3 conflict commands, 3 hooks. L3+L4 (LLM-driven semantic + architectural detection) stubbed for rc.1.

### Added — Conflict detection + freeze state machine

**Scripts (2 new under `scripts/conflicts/`)**
- `check-l1-files.sh` — file-set intersection between proposed task artifacts and pending-confirm sibling artifacts. Returns JSON `{layer, overlap, confidence, files, with}`. p95 well under 100ms (no LLM, no network).
- `check-l2-syntactic.sh` — function/class/def overlap via regex within files L1 flagged. Confidence 0.85 (lower than L1's 1.0 because regex on symbol names has false-positive risk).

**Agents (1 new — 14 → 15)**
- `agents/conflict-arbiter.md` — adjudicates conflicts. Decision table: auto_thaw / auto_discard / sequential_reorder / replan / escalate / user_priority. L3+L4 routes to user_priority (never auto-applied). Cycle guard: refuses 4th arbitration of same conflict_id.

**Skills (1 new — 52 → 53)**
- `skills/conflict-detector/SKILL.md` — orchestrates L1-L4 dispatch per spec §21.3. L1+L2 functional via the bash scripts; L3+L4 return stub findings pending rc.1 LLM dispatchers. Writes records to `.aura/plans/conflicts.jsonl` (append-only, schema per spec §21.4).

**Commands (3 new — 18 → 21)**
- `/aura-frog:plan-freeze <NODE_ID> [reason]` — manual freeze with descendant cascade (per spec §13.1, decision Q10 — descendants only, NOT siblings)
- `/aura-frog:plan-thaw <NODE_ID>` — reverse freeze with compatibility check (`git diff <blocker.git_sha>..HEAD` vs frozen sibling's planned artifacts). `--partial` keeps descendants frozen; `--discard` finalizes as discarded; `--grant-replan-budget N` overrides budget reset
- `/aura-frog:plan-conflicts list|show|resolve|history|check` — full conflict lifecycle UX. `resolve <CONFLICT-ID> <choice>` supports accept-proposed / accept-blocker / sequential / freeze-both / escalate

**Rule (1 new — 67 → 68; workflow 28 → 29)**
- `rules/workflow/conflict-arbitration-policy.md` — formalizes auto vs manual boundary (L1/L2 auto, L3/L4 manual), freeze cascade rules (Q10: descendants only), replan_budget interaction, cycle guard (3-arbitration limit), compatibility-check pseudocode

**Hooks (3 new — 38 → 41)**
- `pre-dispatch-conflict-check.cjs` — PreToolUse async on Edit|Write|Bash. Resolves siblings under same Story, runs L1, drills to L2 on low-confidence overlap. Mints CONFLICT-NNNNN, appends conflicts.jsonl + history.jsonl, emits stderr hint with `/aura-frog:plan-conflicts show` next step. Anti-block: informational only; arbiter applies actual mutations
- `post-execute-conflict-rescan.cjs` — PostToolUse async on Edit|Write. Detects recent execution_completed events, looks up frozen siblings tied to same conflict, runs `git diff <blocker.checkpoint.git_sha>..HEAD` vs frozen sibling planned artifacts, emits auto_thaw / auto_discard recommendation
- `pending-confirm-timeout.cjs` — SessionStart async. Walks T4 nodes, surfaces those in `planned`/`frozen`/`blocked` status idle >24h (configurable via `AF_PENDING_TIMEOUT_HOURS`). Cap: 5 surfaced + tail count

**Skill update**
- `skills/failure-classifier/SKILL.md` — F6 class formalized (was a TODO note). Decision rule #2: `cause: conflict OR conflict_id non-null → F6`. Output: `routes_to: conflict-arbiter` (NOT replanner).

### Acceptance criteria — beta.2 sub-scope

- [x] L1 detects file overlap on smoke fixture (1/1; 30-fixture suite deferred to rc.1)
- [x] L2 drills into overlapping files when L1 confidence < 0.95 (1/1)
- [x] CONFLICT-NNNNN records minted with proper schema; conflicts.jsonl append-only
- [x] Frozen node remains frozen until explicit thaw
- [x] Branch freeze cascades to descendants only (NOT siblings) — per spec §13.1, Q10
- [x] /aura-frog:plan-thaw runs compatibility check via git_sha
- [x] F6 class added to failure-classifier with conflict-arbiter dispatch
- [x] L1 detection well under 100ms p95 (bash + comm + sort, no LLM)
- [x] End-to-end tested: artifact map → L1 hit → CONFLICT-00001 minted → conflicts.jsonl + history.jsonl + counters.json all updated

### Verification

- `validate-counts.sh`: 15 / 53 / 68 / 21 / 41 — all OK
- `validate-plan-tree.sh`: 6 nodes · 8/8 invariants
- Reference integrity: zero orphans
- L1 + L2 smoke tests pass (4 scenarios)
- End-to-end conflict detection: TASK-00125 vs TASK-00120 sharing src/auth.py → CONFLICT-00001 logged correctly

### Stats (v3.7.0-beta.1 → v3.7.0-beta.2)

- Agents: 14 → **15** (+1 conflict-arbiter)
- Skills: 52 → **53** (+1 conflict-detector); auto-invoke 9 (unchanged)
- Rules: 67 → **68** (+1 conflict-arbitration-policy); workflow 28 → **29**
- Commands: 18 → **21** (+3: /aura-frog:plan-freeze, /aura-frog:plan-thaw, /aura-frog:plan-conflicts)
- Hooks: 38 → **41** (+3)
- MCP servers: 6 (unchanged)

### Pending for v3.7.0-rc.1 (Milestone E)

- L3 (semantic LLM) + L4 (architectural LLM) full implementations + conflict_cache.jsonl LRU
- 30+20+15+10 conflict fixture suites for L1-L4 acceptance corpus
- Pre-flight Tier 2 (OPA, optional) — install-opa.sh + 5 default Rego policies
- Self-healing orchestrator — F2/F3 propose patch, never auto-apply
- MCP security tier — per-agent allowlist, audit log, rate limits
- Phase-Role binding hard rule (Phase 4 reviewer ≠ Phase 3 builder)
- /aura-frog:dashboard CLI

### Pending — deferred FEAT-B work (rolling)

- Classifier 80-fixture suite + hallucination/logic-error fixture suites + deviation_score auto-update + trace-event latency benchmark

### Fixed (post-beta.1)

- **Agent dispatch namespacing — derived not hardcoded.** First fix wired the `aura-frog:` prefix into the dispatch table (worked, but fragile across forks/renames). Refactored to derivation: the prefix is now read at runtime from `plugin.json#name` via `scripts/get-plugin-prefix.sh` (new helper, falls back to grep when `jq` unavailable). The session-start hook (`hooks/session-start.cjs`) emits the prefix in its banner: `🔌 plugin-prefix: aura-frog (use as subagent_type prefix: \`aura-frog:<agent-id>\`)` — so the AI sees it once per session, no per-call lookup. `skills/run-orchestrator/SKILL.md` dispatch table now uses bare agent IDs (`architect`, `tester`, etc.) with a note to apply the runtime prefix at the moment of Agent tool invocation. `rules/core/agent-namespacing.md` rewritten as derivation-based: lists agent IDs (stable) and looks up the prefix from plugin.json (variable). Skills/rules/docs are now fork-safe — only `plugin.json` + `marketplace.json` need updating on rename. Rules: 66 → **67** (core 21 → **22**).

## [3.7.0-beta.1] - 2026-05-06 (Milestone C complete — Pre-flight Tier 1)

> Internal pre-release tag. Not published to marketplace. Completes FEAT-C with the pre-flight half. Tier 2 OPA Rego policies deferred to rc.1 per spec §20.4 (Tier 2 is optional).

### Added — Pre-flight Tier 1 (7 bash linters + dispatcher hook)

**Scripts (7 new under `scripts/preflight/`)**
- `validate-frontmatter.sh` — YAML frontmatter validation on plan/skill/agent/rule/command markdown
- `validate-tool-input.sh` — tool input shape sanity (required fields, absolute paths, no-op edits)
- `validate-tool-output.sh` — ANSI-escape volume, prompt-injection phrase detection, JSON sanity
- `check-path-safety.sh` — reject path traversal + system files (`/etc/passwd`, `~/.ssh/`, `~/.aws/`) + credential dirs
- `check-command-allowlist.sh` — hard-block destructive (`rm -rf /`, `mkfs.*`, fork bomb, pipe-to-sudo-shell, etc.); warn on risky (`git push --force`, `DROP TABLE`)
- `check-secret-patterns.sh` — high-confidence credential patterns (AWS/GitHub PAT/OpenAI/JWT/private keys); warn on heuristic patterns
- `run-all.sh` — orchestrator. Auto-dispatches based on `CLAUDE_TOOL_NAME` + `CLAUDE_TOOL_ARGS`. Returns highest exit code from any linter

Each linter follows spec §20.2 exit codes: 0 pass / 1 warn / 2 fail.

**Hook (1 new — 37 → 38)**
- `hooks/pre-flight-validate.cjs` — PreToolUse on Bash | Edit | Write | Read. Invokes `run-all.sh`. Exit 2 → blocks tool call. Exit 1 → warn but proceed. Exit 0 → silent. Honors `AF_PREFLIGHT_DISABLED=true` and single-use bypass via `.claude/logs/.preflight-bypass` flag file (per-call only, per spec Q7). After 3 bypasses in one session, prints warning banner.

**Skill (1 new — 51 → 52)**
- `skills/preflight-validator/` — programmatic wrapper for on-demand invocation (CI, contributor workflow, batch validation). On-demand only.

**Command (1 new — 17 → 18)**
- `commands/preflight.md` — `/aura-frog:preflight check|policies|bypass|status`. `bypass <reason>` requires reason ≥10 chars (refuses vague "test it"). Logs to history.jsonl.

**Rule (1 new — 65 → 66; workflow 27 → 28)**
- `rules/workflow/preflight-policies.md` — formalizes triggers, hard-block vs warn pattern classes, exit-code semantics, bypass policy (per-call only), 3-bypasses-warn threshold, escalation order (per-call → per-session env → permanent — strongly discouraged).

### Acceptance criteria — beta.1 sub-scope

- [x] All 7 Tier 1 linters defined; each returns 0/1/2 per spec §20.2
- [x] `pre-flight-validate.cjs` blocks tool call on exit 2; warns on exit 1
- [x] `/aura-frog:preflight bypass` is single-use (consumed on next PreToolUse)
- [x] After 3 bypasses in a session: warning banner emitted
- [x] Hook silent if `AF_PREFLIGHT_DISABLED=true`
- [x] Hook silent if `run-all.sh` missing
- [x] Smoke tests: 10/10 pass (hard-block / warn / pass for each linter; dispatcher correctness)

### Verification

- `validate-counts.sh`: 14 / 52 / 66 / 18 / 38 — all OK
- `validate-plan-tree.sh`: 5 nodes · 8/8 invariants
- Reference integrity: zero orphans
- Linter smoke tests: rm -rf / blocked, force-push warned, ls passed, /etc/passwd blocked, traversal blocked, AWS key detected, GitHub PAT detected, clean content passed, run-all dispatch correct
- Hook smoke tests: hard-block exit 2, warn exit 0 with stderr, pass exit 0 silent, AF_PREFLIGHT_DISABLED skips entirely

### Stats (v3.7.0-alpha.4 → v3.7.0-beta.1)

- Agents: 14 (unchanged)
- Skills: 51 → **52** (+1 preflight-validator); auto-invoke 9 (unchanged)
- Rules: 65 → **66** (+1 preflight-policies); workflow 27 → **28**
- Commands: 17 → **18** (+1 /aura-frog:preflight)
- Hooks: 37 → **38** (+1 pre-flight-validate)
- MCP servers: 6 (unchanged)

### Pending for v3.7.0-rc.1 (Milestone E remainder)

- **Pre-flight Tier 2 (OPA, optional)** — `install-opa.sh` (sha256-verified) + 5 default Rego policies (plan_structure / mutation_safety / grounding / token_budget / conflict_respect)
- **Self-healing orchestrator** — F2/F3 propose patch, never auto-apply
- **MCP security tier** — per-agent allowlist (`mcp_servers:` frontmatter), `mcp-call-gate.cjs` hook, audit log, rate limits
- **Phase-Role binding** — Phase 4 reviewer ≠ Phase 3 builder hard rule enforcement
- **CLI dashboard** — `/aura-frog:dashboard`

### Pending for v3.7.0-beta.2 (Milestone D)

- L1-L4 conflict detection + conflict-arbiter agent + F6 class
- 3 conflict commands (`/aura-frog:plan-freeze`, `:thaw`, `:conflicts`)
- Branch freeze cascade + auto-thaw

### Pending — deferred FEAT-B work (rolling)

- Classifier 80-fixture suite + hallucination/logic-error fixture suites + deviation_score auto-update + trace-event latency benchmark

### Added (post-alpha.4)

- **Deterministic JSON → TOON projection** — `scripts/json-to-toon.cjs` (CLI + library) projects JSON via built-in schemas (`jira` / `mcp` / `tests` / `pr` / `pkg` / `generic`) or custom dotpaths, encodes as TOON. `hooks/json-toon-projector.cjs` (PostToolUse Read | mcp__.*) shape-sniffs incoming JSON, runs the converter, emits TOON to stderr alongside the raw output. Skips small payloads (<2KB), plugin config files, non-JSON. **No AI involvement** — projection is script-side, saving the round-trip + tokens that an AI-side rule would have cost. `hooks/jira-auto-fetch.cjs` updated to call the converter for stderr emission. Hooks: 36 → **37**. Spec rationale: an originally drafted `rules/core/json-to-toon.md` rule was deleted in favor of the hook because rules are always-loaded (token cost) and ask the model to convert AFTER receiving raw JSON — a deterministic hook does the work BEFORE the model sees anything.

### Fixed (post-alpha.4)

- **Anti-overload context discipline** — added `rules/core/context-economy.md` (Critical priority, always-loaded). Addresses upstream `overloaded_error` from large context: locate-before-Read ladder (Glob → Grep paths → Grep content → targeted Read with offset+limit → full Read as last resort), skip rules for build artifacts / lockfiles / minified files, no-re-Read discipline, recovery procedure on overload error (do NOT retry with same context — distill, then resume), token budget per session class (Quick <10K / Standard <60K / Deep <150K tool-results total). Cited from run-orchestrator (Phase 1 setup), bugfix-quick (investigation step), code-reviewer (review evidence). Rules: 64 → **65** (core 20 → **21**).

## [3.7.0-alpha.4] - 2026-05-05 (Milestone C interim — Memory Tier)

> Internal pre-release tag. Not published to marketplace. Ships the memory half of FEAT-C: epic-summarizer + permanent_memory + session reset. Pre-flight half + 7 Tier 1 linters + OPA optional + deferred FEAT-B fixtures land in beta.1.

### Added — Memory tier

**Agents (1 new — 13 → 14)**
- `agents/epic-summarizer.md` — distills T2 done into a permanent_memory.md section. Confidence-scored output (items <0.7 → Tentative subsection). Hard cap: 500 tokens/Epic. Writes ONLY to `.aura/memory/`. Never includes verbatim file content (sha256 references instead).

**Skills (2 new — 49 → 51; auto-invoke 8 → 9)**
- `skills/permanent-memory-loader/` — auto-invoke. Loads permanent_memory.md summary lines (≤120 tokens always-loaded; 200 hard cap). Silent if no `.aura/memory/`. Auto-degrades by dropping Tentative → Patterns → Epic-IDs-only.
- `skills/plan-archivist/` — on-demand. Compresses completed plan-tree branches to `.aura/plans/archive/{NODE_ID}.summary.md`. Optional `--prune` removes original Story/Task files (always preserved in checkpoints).

**Commands (1 new — 16 → 17)**
- `commands/reset-session.md` — distills active Epic via epic-summarizer → permanent_memory.md → optional reset prompt. Preserves history.jsonl, plan tree, conflict cache, manual_overrides.md. Supports `--feature`, `--initiative`, `--dry-run`, `--no-prompt`.

**Rules (1 new — 63 → 64; workflow 26 → 27)**
- `rules/workflow/session-reset-policy.md` — formalizes triggers (T2 done default, T1 quarterly, manual), distillation include/exclude rules, 500/8000 token caps, confidence-tiered output, what's preserved across reset.

**Hooks (2 new — 34 → 36)**
- `hooks/feature-done-trigger-archive.cjs` — PostToolUse Edit|Write. Detects T2 status transition `active → done` via history.jsonl tail. Surfaces `/aura-frog:reset-session` suggestion.
- `hooks/session-reset-trigger.cjs` — PostToolUse Edit|Write. After epic-summarizer writes a section (within 60s window), prompts user to actually reset the session. Per-feature flag prevents spam.

### Acceptance criteria — alpha.4 sub-scope

- [x] epic-summarizer agent defined with 500-token cap + confidence tiers + .aura/memory/ write-only
- [x] permanent-memory-loader auto-invokes, ≤120 tokens, silent without `.aura/memory/`
- [x] plan-archivist defined with --prune opt-in
- [x] /aura-frog:reset-session distills and offers reset; preserves what spec §19.5 says it should
- [x] session-reset-policy formalizes triggers + caps + preservation list
- [x] feature-done-trigger-archive emits hint on T2 done detection
- [x] session-reset-trigger prompts user post-distillation (anti-spam flag)
- [x] All 4 hook scenarios tested (no plans / done detection / no recent summarize / recent summarize)

### Verification

- `validate-counts.sh`: 14 / 51 / 64 / 17 / 36 — all OK
- `validate-plan-tree.sh`: 5 nodes · 8/8 invariants
- Reference integrity: zero orphans
- Hook smoke test: silent without `.aura/plans/`, fires correctly with active.json + history.jsonl events

### Stats (v3.7.0-alpha.3 → v3.7.0-alpha.4)

- Agents: 13 → **14** (+1 epic-summarizer)
- Skills: 49 → **51** (+2); auto-invoke 8 → **9** (+permanent-memory-loader)
- Rules: 63 → **64** (+1 session-reset-policy); workflow 26 → **27**
- Commands: 16 → **17** (+1 /aura-frog:reset-session)
- Hooks: 34 → **36** (+2)
- MCP servers: 6 (unchanged)

### Pending for beta.1 (rest of FEAT-C)

- preflight-validator skill + /aura-frog:preflight command + preflight-policies workflow rule
- pre-flight-validate.cjs hook
- 7 Tier 1 bash linters + install-opa.sh (sha256 verified)
- 5 OPA Rego policies (plan_structure, mutation_safety, grounding, token_budget, conflict_respect)
- **Deferred from FEAT-B** — classifier 80-fixture suite, hallucination/logic-error fixture suites, deviation_score auto-update, trace-event latency benchmark
- Post-reset session-load benchmark (<2s target)

### Fixed (post-alpha.3)

- **JIRA auto-fetch wired** — `jira-fetch.sh` existed but had no UserPromptSubmit hook driving it. Added `hooks/jira-auto-fetch.cjs`: detects `[A-Z]{2,10}-[0-9]{1,6}` patterns in the user prompt, fetches via curl directly to the Atlassian REST API, caches per-project at `.claude/logs/jira/{TICKET_ID}.json` with 24h TTL, surfaces a one-line summary per ticket to stderr. Silent if JIRA env vars unset (one-time hint per session). Cap: 3 tickets/prompt. Optional `JIRA_PROJECT_PREFIXES` env (comma-separated) acts as an allowlist to filter false positives like `RFC-123` / `UTF-8`. Credentials never leak in error output. `run-orchestrator` skill updated to consume the cache as a canonical requirements source. Hooks: 33 → **34** (rolled into alpha.4 count of 36).

## [3.7.0-alpha.3] - 2026-05-04 (Milestone C interim — Project-level Extension Creation)

> Internal pre-release tag. Not published to marketplace. Addresses user directive 2026-05-04: auto-detect when a new skill/rule/command would help, ask for confirmation, create at project-Claude level only.

### Added — Project-level extension creation

**Skills (1 new — 48 → 49; auto-invoke 7 → 8)**
- `skills/extension-detector/` — auto-invoke. Detects strong/medium signals that a new skill/rule/command would reduce friction. NEVER writes files itself; surfaces a one-line proposal and waits for explicit `y` / `yes` confirmation. Detection budget: 1 proposal/turn, 3/session.

**Commands (1 new — 15 → 16)**
- `commands/extend.md` — `/aura-frog:extend propose|create|list|remove`. Always writes to `.claude/{skills,rules,commands}/` in the user's project — **NEVER to plugin's `aura-frog/` folder** (hard path-prefix check). Includes reference-integrity audit step + extensions.log append.

**Rules (1 new — 62 → 63; workflow 25 → 26)**
- `rules/workflow/extension-policy.md` — formalizes signal thresholds (strong/medium/weak with occurrence requirements), confirmation gate as non-negotiable, project-only write constraint, frontmatter requirements for project extensions, anti-fatigue budget caps.

### Acceptance criteria — all green for alpha.3 sub-scope

- [x] extension-detector auto-invokes only on signal threshold match (3+ for medium, 1 for strong)
- [x] /aura-frog:extend supports propose/create/list/remove
- [x] extension-policy formalizes thresholds + confirmation gate + project-only writes
- [x] Hard guardrail: write paths starting with `aura-frog/` rejected immediately
- [x] Mandatory user confirmation before any file creation
- [x] Detection budget: 1/turn, 3/session
- [x] Reference-integrity audit runs after every create

### Why ship as interim alpha.3

FEAT-C (Milestone C) standard scope is large: epic-summarizer, permanent-memory, 7 Tier 1 linters, 5 OPA policies, session reset flow. The user directive (auto-detect skills/rules/commands) is a smaller orthogonal capability. Splitting:

- **alpha.3** ships extension-detector standalone — fast feedback on the new feature
- **beta.1** ships full FEAT-C standard scope + deferred FEAT-B fixture suites

This keeps each pre-release reviewable and avoids bundling unrelated changes.

### Stats (v3.7.0-alpha.2 → v3.7.0-alpha.3)

- Agents: 13 (unchanged)
- Skills: 48 → **49** (+1 extension-detector); auto-invoke 7 → **8**
- Rules: 62 → **63** (+1 extension-policy); workflow 25 → **26**
- Commands: 15 → **16** (+1 /aura-frog:extend)
- Hooks: 33 (unchanged)
- MCP servers: 6 (unchanged)

### Pending for subsequent milestones

- **Milestone C remainder (beta.1)** — epic-summarizer, plan-archivist, permanent-memory-loader, preflight-validator, /aura-frog:reset-session, /aura-frog:preflight, session-reset-policy + preflight-policies rules, 3 hooks (feature-done-trigger-archive, pre-flight-validate, session-reset-trigger), 7 Tier 1 linters, OPA install + 5 Rego policies
- **Deferred from FEAT-B** — classifier 80-fixture suite, hallucination/logic-error fixture suites, deviation_score auto-update, trace-event latency benchmark
- **Milestone D (beta.2)** — L1-L4 conflict detection, conflict-arbiter, F6 class
- **Milestone E (rc.1)** — self-healing safety gates, MCP per-agent allowlist + audit, phase-role binding hard enforcement

## [3.7.0-alpha.2] - 2026-04-29 (Milestone B — Failure Handling + Reasoning Trace)

> Internal pre-release tag. Not published to marketplace. All 11 acceptance criteria green.

### Added — Failure handling + reasoning trace

**Plan tree**
- `.aura/plans/features/FEAT-B/feature.md` (Milestone B), INIT-001 children → `[FEAT-A, FEAT-B]`

**Agents (1 new — 12 → 13)**
- `agents/replanner.md` — F2-F4 mutation proposer (re-decompose / discard_task / reprioritize / promote / freeze). Read-only on code; only LLM-mediated planning agent (per Q1 decision).

**Skills (3 new — 45 → 48; auto-invoke 5 → 7)**
- `skills/failure-classifier/` — F1-F5 deterministic classifier. Outputs `{class, confidence, evidence, recommended_action}`. No LLM call.
- `skills/reasoning-trace-recorder/` — auto-invoke. Emits `file_read | output_claim | tool_call | tool_result | decision | phase_transition` events to `.aura/plans/traces/{TASK_ID}.jsonl`.
- `skills/plan-validator/` — wrapper over `validate-plan-tree.sh`; closes a reference gap from alpha.1 (was promised, never built).

**Rules (3 new — 59 → 62; core 18 → 20, workflow 22 → 25)**
- `rules/core/grounding-discipline.md` — `output_claim` must be preceded by a `file_read` for the named file/symbol; ungrounded claims surface in `/aura-frog:trace --hallucinations`.
- `rules/workflow/replan-thresholds.md` — `replan_budget` per tier (T2=2, T3=3, T4=0), `deviation_score` formula, freeze-on-exhaustion + cycle guard.
- `rules/workflow/checkpoint-discipline.md` — pre-mutation snapshots in `.aura/plans/checkpoints/`, retention (5 per node / 30 days / 50 MB cap), idempotent restore semantics.

**Commands (1 new — 14 → 15; +1 upgrade)**
- `commands/trace.md` — read traces by TASK_ID, filter by event type, surface ungrounded claims (`--hallucinations`).
- `commands/plan-undo.md` — full implementation (alpha.1 was a stub): LIFO checkpoint restore, idempotent (no-op on second run), refuses on missing checkpoint.

**Hooks (3 new — 30 → 33; all 5 planning hooks now wired into hooks.json)**
- `hooks/post-execute-update-node.cjs` — PostToolUse. Records execution_completed/execution_failed events to history.jsonl; surfaces failure-classifier hint on non-zero exit.
- `hooks/tdd-red-failure-tracker.cjs` — Bash PostToolUse, P2_RED only. Distinguishes `red_as_designed` from `red_unexpectedly_green` (F2 candidate).
- `hooks/tool-call-tracer.cjs` — PreToolUse + PostToolUse. Emits `tool_call`, `tool_result`, and (for Read) `file_read` events with sha256 truncated to 16 chars.
- **Wired up** in `hooks/hooks.json`: alpha.1's two hooks (`pre-execute-load-plan-context`, `session-start-restore-active`) plus the three new alpha.2 hooks now fire on the appropriate Claude Code lifecycle events. All silent on projects without `.aura/plans/`.

### Acceptance criteria — all green

- [x] failure-classifier returns F1-F5 with confidence ≥ 0.6
- [x] replanner emits proposals respecting `replan_budget`; refuses on exhaustion
- [x] reasoning-trace-recorder writes append-only `traces/{TASK_ID}.jsonl`
- [x] `/aura-frog:trace` reads traces and surfaces ungrounded claims
- [x] grounding-discipline rule defines `grounded:bool` semantics
- [x] post-execute-update-node hook records execution events to history.jsonl
- [x] tdd-red-failure-tracker hook distinguishes RED-as-designed from F2 candidate
- [x] tool-call-tracer hook emits tool_call/tool_result/file_read events
- [x] /aura-frog:plan-undo full implementation honors checkpoint LIFO + idempotent
- [x] checkpoint-discipline rule defines retention + restore semantics
- [x] replan-thresholds rule defines deviation_score + budget enforcement

### Verification

- `validate-counts.sh`: 13 agents · 48 skills · 62 rules · 15 commands · 33 hooks — all OK
- `validate-plan-tree.sh`: 4 nodes · 8/8 invariants pass
- `check-token-budget.sh`: 212 / 13,500 tokens (1% utilization, well under hard limit)
- Hook smoke test: all 5 silent-exit on no `.aura/plans/`; emit correct events on active plan tree

### Stats (v3.7.0-alpha.1 → v3.7.0-alpha.2)

- Agents: 12 → **13** (+1 replanner)
- Skills: 45 → **48** (+3); auto-invoke 5 → **7** (+plan-loader was alpha.1, +reasoning-trace-recorder)
- Rules: 59 → **62** (+3); core 18 → 20, workflow 22 → 25
- Commands: 14 → **15** (+1 /aura-frog:trace; /aura-frog:plan-undo upgraded from stub to full)
- Hooks: 30 → **33** (+3); all 5 planning hooks now wired in hooks.json
- MCP servers: 6 (unchanged)

### Pending for subsequent milestones

- **Milestone C (beta.1)** — session reset, pre-flight (Tier 1 bash + optional OPA Tier 2), epic-summarizer, permanent-memory-loader, prune-checkpoints.sh
- **Milestone D (beta.2)** — L1-L4 conflict detection, conflict-arbiter, F6 class, freeze cascade
- **Milestone E (rc.1)** — self-healing safety gates, MCP per-agent allowlist + audit, phase-role binding hard enforcement

## [3.7.0-alpha.1] - 2026-04-21 (Milestone A — Planning Foundation)

> Internal pre-release tag. Not published to marketplace. All 6 spec acceptance criteria green.

### Added — Hierarchical planning foundation

**Specs & decisions**
- `docs/specs/AURA_FROG_V3.7.0_TECH_SPEC.md` — authoritative tech spec (summary form; §3-33 transcribed per milestone)
- `docs/specs/V3.7.0_DECISIONS.md` — all 17 §32 decisions resolved with spec recommendations + env var inventory

**Plan tree (gitignored, project-local per Q2)**
- `.aura/plans/` skeleton: mission.md, INIT-001.md, FEAT-A/feature.md, .counters.json, active.json, history.jsonl

**Agents (4 new — 9 → 12)**
- `agents/master-planner.md` — kernel controller skeleton (decision engine arrives Milestone B)
- `agents/strategist.md` — T0-T1 hierarchical-planning section appended (preserves original business-strategy role)
- `agents/feature-architect.md` — T2 → T3 decomposition (read-only on code)
- `agents/story-planner.md` — T3 → T4 decomposition, pairs with TDD Phase 1

**Skills (1 new — auto-invoke)**
- `skills/plan-loader/` — `user-invocable: false`, ≤800 always-loaded tokens, auto-degradation on size

**Rules (2 new)**
- `rules/core/plan-trust-policy.md` — `trust: plan` memory tier between `trust: user` and `trust: file`
- `rules/workflow/plan-lifecycle.md` — state machine + Phase 4 reviewer ≠ Phase 3 builder hard rule

**Commands (8 new — 6 → 14)**

- `hooks/session-start-restore-active.cjs` — SessionStart: emits `🐸 Active plan` banner; appends `event: session_start` to history.jsonl

**Scripts**
- `scripts/plans/new-plan.sh` — idempotent skeleton initializer
- `scripts/plans/validate-plan-tree.sh` — enforces all 8 invariants from spec §6.7 (parent existence, children integrity, no orphans, valid status, monotonic revision, test_ref existence, DAG no-cycles, freeze_reason)
- `scripts/plans/render-plan-tree.sh` — ASCII tree renderer with status icons (○ planned, ▶ active, ✓ done, ■ blocked, ❄ frozen, ✗ discarded, ⌂ archived)
- `scripts/plans/test-roundtrip.sh` — sha256-based byte-identical round-trip test
- `scripts/plans/check-token-budget.sh` — counts plan-tree lines, hard limit 13,500

### Acceptance criteria — all green

- [x] new-plan.sh idempotent skeleton creation

- [x] ASCII tree renders correctly
- [x] Token budget 212 / 13,500 = 1% utilization (well under hard limit)

### Stats (v3.6.1 → v3.7.0-alpha.1)

- Agents: 9 → **12** (+3, master-planner extends to 4 if counting strategist's appended role)
- Skills: 44 → **45** (+1 plan-loader; auto-invoke 5 → 5 unchanged in count, plan-loader replaces nothing)
- Rules: 57 → **59** (+2)
- Commands: 6 → **14** (+8)
- Hooks: 28 → **30** (+2)

- CONTRIBUTING.md "Behavioral Evaluation" section with local-run instructions + baseline-update policy
- README "Trigger Accuracy" badge linking to EVAL_SETUP
- Requires repo secret: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

**Coverage Skills (3 new)**
- `skills/deep-debugging` — Scientific-method root-cause analysis for intermittent/flaky/race bugs. Protocol: reproduce → hypothesis tree (via tree-of-thoughts) → bisect → test one hypothesis → verify via chain-of-verification → regression test. Escalation from bugfix-quick.
- `skills/monorepo` — pnpm/yarn/npm workspaces, Turborepo, Nx, Lerna, Rust/Go workspaces. Correct package scoping, cross-package coordination, build-graph awareness. Uses `paths:` frontmatter to auto-load on workspace file detection.
- `skills/perf-profiling` — Measure-first optimization with Pareto bottleneck targeting. Language-specific profiler suggestions (clinic/py-spy/pprof/flamegraph), one-change-at-a-time discipline, flat-distribution detection for architectural calls.

### Changed

- Skills: 41 → **44** (5 auto-invoke unchanged, reference 36 → 39)
- plugin.json + marketplace.json descriptions prefix "Portable" + adapter timeline
- bugfix-quick SKILL escalates to deep-debugging for hard bugs

- Codex/Cursor adapters — documented roadmap, target Q2 2026

---

## [3.6.1] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Security & discipline rules** — 7 new policy rules: `no-assumption`, `prompt-validation` (6-dim benchmark), `contextual-separation` (prompt-injection defense), `recursion-limit` (loop prevention), `observer-agent` (watchdog role), `prompt-caching` (Anthropic cache_control), `small-to-large-routing` (haiku→sonnet→opus), `dual-llm-review` (adversarial second-opinion), `immutable-workflow` (approved phases append-only)
- **`skills/prompt-evaluator`** — added Mode 3: Output Variance (run N times, score stability 0-100%)
- **`docs/reference/BENEFITS.md`** — full why-use-this-plugin doc (~460 lines, 8 parts, use cases)
- **Reference Integrity Rule** in `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — audit script + enforcement policy for future refactors
- **Reviewer cap = 2 per phase** in `cross-review-workflow.md` — analysis-paralysis defense

### Changed
- Core rule tier: 13 → 18 (added 5 rules)
- Workflow rule tier: 20 → 22 (added 2 rules)
- Total rules: 50 → 57 (18 core + 17 agent + 22 workflow)

### Fixed
- **CLAUDE.md discrepancies:** commands table was missing `/help` (now 6 commands); auto-invoke skill list incorrectly included `run-orchestrator` (which has no `autoInvoke: true` frontmatter — now correctly 5 skills)
- **Skills README count mismatch:** propagated the 6→5 auto-invoke fix across 5 files (skills/README, docs/README, root README ×3, CONTRIBUTING)
- **7 dead reference paths:** `skills/debugging/SKILL.md` → `skills/bugfix-quick/SKILL.md` (merged in v3.5); `skills/chain-of-verification.md` → `/SKILL.md` suffix; `rules/logging-standards.md` → `/agent/` tier; `rules/next-step-guidance.md` → `/workflow/` tier; `docs/WORKFLOW_DIAGRAMS.md` → `/architecture/` subdir

### Stats
- Rules: 57 (was 50)
- Core rules: 18 (was 13)
- Workflow rules: 22 (was 20)

---

## [3.6.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **3 reasoning techniques from published research** (opt-in via `/run reason:` prefix; auto-enabled in specific phases)
  - `self-consistency` — N independent paths + majority vote (Wang et al. 2022) — Phase 1 Deep trade-off decisions
  - `tree-of-thoughts` — Branch/evaluate/prune/backtrack (Yao et al. 2023) — P1 architecture + P4 refactor planning
  - `chain-of-verification` — Draft → verify via tool → revise (Dhuliawala et al. 2023) — **MANDATORY in Phase 4** for factual claims
  - Each has a workflow-tier rule (policy) + reference skill (playbook)
- **Prompt validation (6-dimension benchmark)** — New core rule `rules/core/prompt-validation.md`. Every actionable prompt scored on Precondition, Context, Requirement, Criteria, Expect/Actual, Output. Complexity-gated thresholds (Quick/Standard/Deep). Threshold fail → focused questions before execution.
- **No-assumption rule** — New core rule `rules/core/no-assumption.md`. "If in doubt, ASK. Never guess, never fabricate." Concrete anti-patterns, ≤2 questions per turn, honors force-mode prefixes.
- **Agent YAML frontmatter** — All 9 agents now declare `name`, `description`, `tools` (allowlist per role), `color`, optional `model`. Security + strategist are read-only (no Edit/Write/Bash). Scanner uses haiku. Architect/frontend/mobile/lead inherit session model (Opus sessions → Opus for design work).
- **4 Mermaid diagrams in root README** — How It Works, Agent Detection, Routing Strategies, Walkthrough Sequence. High-contrast colors for GitHub light/dark mode.
- **README sections** — Full Installation with verification, Walkthrough with mock terminal transcript, Command Reference (6 commands with examples), Agent Selection Examples (10 rows), Token Budget breakdown, Troubleshooting/FAQ (7 collapsed Q&As), Compared to Other Plugins (vs wshobson/agents, Superpowers).
- **Branding image prompts** — `assets/BRANDING_PROMPTS.md` with 9 minimalist prompts for regenerating mascot/logo/banner assets via Midjourney/DALL-E/Imagen.
- **Frontmatter maintenance rule** — Added to `.claude/CLAUDE.md` so future edits preserve YAML schema + audit script for orphan/dead-link check.

### Changed
- **Commands consolidated 26→6** — `/run` (universal entry), `/check` (verification), `/design` (pre-coding), `/project` (config), `/af` (system), `/help`
- **`/run <task>` auto-detects intent** — bugfix, feature, refactor, test, deploy, review, security, quality — routes to right flow automatically
- **Context-aware actions** — During active run, bare words work: `approve`, `reject`, `modify`, `handoff`, `status`, `progress`, `rollback`, `stop`
- **Renamed workflow-orchestrator → run-orchestrator** — skill, folder, state files all updated
- **Log folder: `.claude/logs/workflows/` → `.claude/logs/runs/`** — hook code aligned to match docs (was the source of "workflow state not saving" bug)
- **Rule tier rebalanced (13/17/20)** — Frontend-specific rules moved from core to agent tier: `direct-hook-access`, `correct-file-extensions`. 3 new workflow rules (reasoning techniques). Core grew from 11 to 13 with `no-assumption` + `prompt-validation`.
- **`api-design-rules.md` slimmed 187→55 lines** — Full design guidance now defers to `api-designer` skill (eliminates rule↔skill duplication).
- **Agent framework experts add `paths:` frontmatter** — 11 framework experts (react/vue/nextjs/angular/flutter/react-native/typescript/nodejs/python/laravel/go) now auto-invoke only on matching file types for precision.
- **Discoverability pass** — Every rule now has ≥1 inbound reference from an agent/skill/CLAUDE.md (was 30 orphaned rules out of 45). Zero dead links across agents/skills/rules.

### Removed
- **Router agent deleted** (`agents/router.md` + `agents/reference/router-patterns.md`) — Functionality already lived in `agent-detector` skill with more coverage and 13× more inbound refs. Unique content (Intent Detection, Tech Detection, Fallbacks) merged into `skills/agent-detector/task-based-agent-selection.md`.

### Fixed
- **Workflow state path drift** — Hook `.cjs` scripts were writing to `.claude/logs/workflows/` while skills read from `.claude/logs/runs/`. Aligned all hook code to `runs/` with legacy fallback for users migrating from pre-3.6 state.

### Stats
- Commands: 6 (was 26)
- Agents: 9 (was 10 — router consolidated)
- Skills: 41 (was 38 — 3 reasoning techniques)
- Rules: 50 (13 core + 17 agent + 20 workflow; was 45)
- Top-level parents: 5 bundled + 1 standalone (was 10 bundled + 16 standalone)

---

## [3.5.0] - 2026-04-14

### Changed
- **Skills optimized 44→38** — Merged overlapping skills, removed empty shells, compressed all to gotchas-only format
- **Auto-invoke budget reduced 6,050→~2,850 tokens** — Removed framework-expert and testing-patterns from auto-invoke, compressed remaining 6 skills
- **10 expert skills rewritten** — Angular, Flutter, Go, Laravel, Next.js, Node.js, Python, React, React Native, Vue now focus on gotchas & decisions (~300-500 tokens each, was 850-1800)
- **6 reference skills compressed** — documentation, git-workflow, problem-solving, sequential-thinking, session-continuation, phase1-lite
- **Workflow command format updated** — All phase docs and help now use `/workflow approve` format (was `workflow:approve`)
- **Skill descriptions optimized** — Added "why this skill helps" to auto-invoke descriptions for better trigger rates

### Added
- **Merged test-writer + testing-patterns** — Single test-writer skill with AAA principles, anti-patterns, framework detection (~500 tokens)
- **Merged debugging → bugfix-quick** — Root cause investigation + TDD fix process in one skill (~400 tokens)
- **Merged design-expert + design-system-library** — Unified design skill with Context7 integration (~400 tokens)

### Removed
- **testing-patterns** — Merged into test-writer (60% content overlap eliminated)
- **debugging** — Merged into bugfix-quick (overlapping triggers resolved)
- **design-system-library** — Merged into design-expert
- **qa-expert** — Empty shell, testing-patterns covered this better
- **dev-expert** — Pure router, framework-expert handles routing
- **pm-expert** — Empty shell with no actual content

### Stats
- Skills: 38 (was 44)
- Auto-invoke skills: 6 (was 8)
- Auto-invoke tokens: ~2,850 (was 6,050)
- Total skill tokens: ~20,000 (was ~34,000)

---

## [3.4.1] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Prompt Quality Evaluator (Mode 2)** — Evaluate and optimize any specific prompt. Scores 5 dimensions (clarity, instruction quality, efficiency, robustness, output alignment) with 0-10 calibration. Detects anti-patterns (filler phrases, redundancy, teaching model what it knows). Outputs minimal fix + production version.

---

## [3.4.0] - 2026-04-13

### Changed
- **Commands consolidated 90→26** (71% reduction) — Merged sub-commands into 10 bundled parent files. Removed 14 redundant command files. 16 standalone files kept. Total lines: ~13,900 → ~613.

---

## [3.3.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Sprint Contract** — After Phase 1 approval, user confirms explicit "done" criteria (scope, acceptance criteria, exclusions, quality gate) before Phase 2 starts. Prevents scope drift. Skippable.
- **Weighted Code Review** — 6 review aspects now weighted by impact: Security (CRITICAL), Architecture (HIGH), Error Handling (HIGH), Test Gaps (HIGH), Type Safety (MEDIUM), Simplification (LOW). 60% of review effort on architecture + edge cases. Syntax left to linters.
- **Model-Aware Compact Strategy** — Sonnet prefers `/clear` + handoff/resume over `/compact` (reasoning degrades with compacted context). Opus handles compaction well. Haiku always prefers `/clear`.
- **Evaluator Calibration** — Structured 10-point score breakdown per review aspect with anchored calibration (9-10 production-ready, 7-8 good, 5-6 needs work, <5 changes requested). Prevents "LGTM" drift.
- **Builder ≠ Reviewer rule** — Phase 3 builder MUST NOT lead Phase 4 review. Security agent is PRIMARY reviewer, tester checks regression. Enforced in execution-rules, cross-review-workflow, code-reviewer, and Phase 4 guide.
- **PostCompact hook** (`hooks/post-compact.cjs`) — Verifies workflow state survived context compaction.
- **statusline refreshInterval** — 30s auto-refresh in settings.

### Fixed
- **Deliverables not re-saved after modify/reject** — Commands updated JSON state but never re-wrote `.md` files to disk.
- **Hooks count** — Was 35 (counted lib/ utilities). Correct: 28 executable hooks.
- **Broken `../../docs/` paths** — 10 refs from plugin files resolved above repo root.
- **prompt-logger hook** — Was reading wrong stdin field (`user_prompt` → `prompt`).
- **thinking-boost + auto-learn hooks** — Same stdin field bug.

---

## [3.2.2] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- **Deliverables not re-saved after modify/reject** — modify and reject commands updated workflow-state.json but never re-wrote deliverable .md files to disk. Added explicit RE-SAVE steps in modify/reject flows, enforcement in deliverables rule, and validation in post-phase hook.
- **Hooks count 35→28** — Was incorrectly counting 8 lib/ utility files as hooks. Only 27 executable .cjs hooks + 1 new PostCompact = 28.
- **Broken `../../docs/` paths** — 10 refs from plugin files resolved above repo root. Fixed to repo-root-relative with "(repo root)" note since human docs aren't shipped with plugin install.
- **Stale component counts** — Synced across plugin.json, marketplace.json, README, CONTRIBUTING, CLAUDE.md, hooks/README, CHANGELOG.

### Added
- **PostCompact hook** (`hooks/post-compact.cjs`) — Verifies workflow state survived context compaction. Checks JSON validity, phase, and agent fields.
- **statusline refreshInterval** — `refreshInterval: 30` in settings.example.json for 30s auto-refresh.
- **effort frontmatter** — workflow-orchestrator (high), code-reviewer (high), bugfix-quick (low).

---

## [3.2.1] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **prompt-logger hook** — Was reading `data.user_prompt` from stdin, but Claude Code sends `data.prompt`. Prompts were never logged.
- **thinking-boost hook** — Same stdin field bug (`user_prompt` → `prompt`)
- **auto-learn hook** — Added stdin JSON parsing (was env-only), now reads `data.prompt`

---

## [3.2.0] - 2026-04-10

### Changed
- **Documentation reorganization** — Separated human docs (`/docs/`) from AI instruction files (`aura-frog/docs/`). Human docs organized into: getting-started, architecture, guides, operations, reference, showcase
- **Token optimization (62% reduction)** — Rewrote 65+ instruction files across all 3 tiers for token efficiency
  - Tier 1 (always loaded): 6,144 → 2,911 lines (53% reduction, ~9,700 tokens/session saved)
  - Tier 2 (per agent): 7,791 → 2,739 lines (65% reduction)
  - Tier 3 (per phase): 4,461 → 1,384 lines (69% reduction)
- **CLAUDE.md** — 293 → 216 lines (27%), compressed TOON tables and removed redundant sections
- **Commands count** — 87 → 90 (3 new commands tracked)
- **Hooks count** — corrected to 27 (was incorrectly counting lib/ utilities)

### Added
- `docs/README.md` — Central human documentation index with 6 categories
- `docs/getting-started/` — GET_STARTED, QUICKSTART, FIRST_WORKFLOW_TUTORIAL
- `docs/architecture/` — OS architecture, config loading, workflow state, diagrams
- `docs/guides/` — Agent selection, teams, design systems, TOON format, usage
- `docs/operations/` — MCP, troubleshooting, security, learning system, cache
- `docs/reference/` — CHANGELOG, TESTING_GUIDE
- `aura-frog/docs/os-architecture.md` — Compact TOON AI reference
- `aura-frog/docs/styling-detection.md` — Compact TOON AI reference
- `aura-frog/docs/usage-clarifications.md` — Compact TOON AI reference
- `aura-frog/templates/README.md` — Index of 15 document templates

### Removed
- `aura-frog/docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Redundant with CHANGELOG.md
- `aura-frog/docs/PLUGIN_INSTALLATION.md` — Content merged into GET_STARTED.md
- `aura-frog/docs/guides/COMMANDS_GUIDE.md` — Content merged into commands/README.md

### Fixed
- Component counts synced across all files (Commands: 90, Hooks: 27, Skills: 44, Rules: 45)
- Cross-links added to 18 previously orphaned documentation files
- Global CLAUDE.md version updated from 2.2.1 to 3.2.0

---

## [3.1.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Prompt Logger hook** (`hooks/prompt-logger.cjs`) — Logs every user prompt with metadata (intent, complexity, word count, commands referenced) to `.claude/metrics/prompts/{date}.jsonl`. 30-day auto-rotation. Disable with `AF_PROMPT_LOGGING=false`.
- **Prompt Evaluator skill** (`skills/prompt-evaluator/SKILL.md`) — Analyze prompt usage patterns and get improvement suggestions. Trigger: `/prompts:evaluate`
- **Prompt Evaluate command** (`commands/metrics/prompt-evaluate.md`) — `/prompts:evaluate [--days N]` generates usage report with intent distribution, feature utilization, gaps, and a 0-100 usage score
- **Evaluate Prompts script** (`scripts/metrics/evaluate-prompts.cjs`) — Analysis engine: computes stats from JSONL logs, generates prioritized suggestions (10 rules), identifies gaps, calculates usage score

### Updated
- Skills: 43 → 44 (added prompt-evaluator)
- Commands: 86 → 87 (added prompts:evaluate)
- Hooks: 26 → 27 (added prompt-logger)
- `hooks.json` — Added prompt-logger to UserPromptSubmit (async)

---

## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-01

### LLM OS Architecture

Major architecture rewrite. Aura Frog now frames Claude Code as an Operating System — Claude as kernel, agents as processes, context window as managed RAM.

#### Added
- **OS Architecture document** (`docs/os-architecture.md`) — Process table, memory segments, 3-tier compression, context switch protocol, golden rules
- **Memory Trust Policy rule** (`rules/core/memory-trust-policy.md`) — Memory as hint + strict write discipline + retrieval hierarchy
- **3-Tier Context Compression** — MicroCompact (free, every 10 turns) → AutoCompact (/compact at 80%) → ManualCompact (session snapshot)
- **Process Table** — 10 agents mapped to PID/state/budget model with context switch protocol

#### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md** — Complete rewrite with OS framing, boot sequence, golden rules, orchestrator principles
- **README.md** — Updated positioning: "An Operating System for software engineering"
- **plugin.json** — New description with LLM OS framing
- Rules: 44 → 45 (13 core + 15 agent + 17 workflow)

#### Principles
- **Memory as Hint** — All cached context treated as hints, verified against actual files before acting
- **Strict Write Discipline** — State only updates after confirmed success
- **Lazy Load Everything** — KERNEL + INDEX on boot (<3K tokens), rest on demand
- **Orchestrate, Don't Execute** — Dispatch to right agent, verify output, advance

---

## [2.3.2] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed
- **validate-counts.sh** — Removed `-maxdepth 1` so rules in subdirs (core/agent/workflow) are counted correctly
- **profile-hooks.sh** — Fixed nanosecond math overflow (octal parsing of `069`) using `10#` prefix
- **set-active-plan.cjs** — Moved from `hooks/` to `scripts/` (was orphaned — CLI utility, not lifecycle hook)

### Fixed
- **sync-settings** — Now merges `statusLine` config from plugin (was ignored, causing broken paths)
- **statusline path** — Fixed `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (not a real var) → hardcoded paths with fallback

### Changed
- **README.md** — Marketing rewrite: benefit-first headings, side-by-side before/after, ~37% shorter
- **Socratic brainstorming** — Slimmed from 15-line detailed instructions to 3-line principle. Agent decides what to ask based on context.
- **CI scripts** — Moved validate-*.sh to `scripts/ci/`, added `generate-stats.sh`

### Updated
- Hooks count: 27 → 26 (set-active-plan moved out)
- Scripts count: 20 → 41 (actual count + moved file)
- All counts synced across README, plugin.json, marketplace.json, CLAUDE.md

---

## [2.3.1] - 2026-03-30

### Remove conversation banner — status line only

#### Removed
- **agent-identification-banner.md** rule — deleted entirely
- **BANNER_EXAMPLES.md** — no longer needed
- All banner instructions from CLAUDE.md, execution-rules, agent-detector, workflow-orchestrator, session-continuation
- Banner from session start steps (6 → 5 steps)

#### Updated
- Rules: 45 → 44 (12 core + 15 agent + 17 workflow)
- CLAUDE.md: "Do NOT render banners in conversation" is now the rule

---

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-30

### Status Line — Banner moves to CLI status bar (0 tokens)

#### Added
- **statusline.sh** — Status line script showing agent, phase, model, context %, cost. Pure bash, no `jq` required
- **statusLine config** in `settings.example.json` — Enabled by default when settings are synced
- **One-time hint** in session-start hook — Prompts user to enable status line if not configured
- **agent/phase fields** in session cache — Status line reads current state from `.claude/cache/session-start-cache.json`

#### Changed
- **Banner rule downgraded** from CRITICAL to LOW — Status line is now primary display, conversation banner is optional
- **CLAUDE.md** — Replaced banner section with status line documentation

#### Token Savings
- ~200 tokens saved per response (no more conversation banners)
- Status line runs outside conversation context (0 token cost)

---

## [2.2.2] - 2026-03-25

### Full repo consistency pass — 116 files

#### Fixed
- **Old agent names** in rules, docs, skills, hooks, templates (30+ instances across 50+ files)
- **Version footers** removed from all rules, skills, docs, hooks, agents files
- **Count mismatches** — README/CLAUDE.md/hooks README all synced to actual: 10/43/89/45/27
- **install.sh** version synced to current
- **Broken file references** — smart-agent-detector.md → agent-detector/SKILL.md
- **Placeholder date** in documentation skill replaced
- **Stale Last Updated lines** removed from all skill files

---

## [2.2.1] - 2026-03-25

- **Obsolete file references** — smart-agent-detector.md→agent-detector/SKILL.md
- **Version footers removed** from all command files
- **Stale version numbers** in banner examples updated

---

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-24

### ClaudeKit Learnings + Showcase + CI

#### Token Optimization Patches (NEW)

Critical patches to reduce token usage from ~200k to ~40k per workflow:

| Patch | Change | Impact |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 1. Agent Detector | `allowed-tools: NONE` (was Read, Grep, Glob) | -10-30k tokens/message |
| 2. Project Context Loader | `autoInvoke: false` (was true) | -15-25k tokens/session |
| 3. Phase 1 Token Cap | 500 token hard cap with TOON format | -5-15k tokens |
| 4. Workflow Orchestrator | Load files on-demand, not all 9+ upfront | -20-40k tokens |
| 5. Token Budget in CLAUDE.md | Phase-by-phase budget enforcement | Governance |

## [1.11.0] - 2026-01-08

### Auto-Learn: Automatic Feedback Detection with Deduplication & Patterns

Learning system now automatically detects corrections and approvals from your messages - no need to run `/learn:feedback` manually!

#### Added
- **Auto-learn hook v2.0** - `hooks/auto-learn.cjs`
  - Fires on every UserPromptSubmit
  - Detects correction patterns: "no", "wrong", "actually", "don't do that", "should be"
  - Detects approval patterns: "good", "great", "perfect", "looks good"
  - Auto-categorizes: code_style, testing, security, code_quality
  - **Deduplication** - Skips identical feedback within 24 hours (MD5 hash)
  - **Pattern detection** - Auto-creates learned patterns after 3+ similar corrections
  - **Local cache** - `.claude/cache/auto-learn-cache.json` for deduplication
  - **Local patterns** - `.claude/cache/learned-patterns.md` human-readable file
  - Non-blocking - never interrupts your flow

#### Updated
- **`hooks.json`** - Added auto-learn hook to UserPromptSubmit
- **`hooks/README.md`** - Documented auto-learn hook (hook #8), updated count to 15 hooks

#### How It Works
```
User: "Don't add comments everywhere"
         ↓
   [Auto-Learn Hook]
         ↓
   Hash: abc123... (check dedup cache)
         ↓
   Not duplicate → increment pattern count
         ↓
   🧠 Learning: Captured correction [code_style:minimal_comments] (2x)
         ↓
   → Recorded to Supabase + local cache

# After 3rd correction about comments:
   🧠 Learning: Pattern detected! "code_style:minimal_comments" (3 occurrences)
         ↓
   → Auto-creates learned pattern in Supabase
```

## [1.10.1] - 2026-01-08

### Bug Fix: Session Hooks Not Loading Environment Variables

#### Fixed
- **Session hooks not loading .envrc** - Hooks that use Supabase (session-start, feedback-capture, session-metrics) now properly source `.envrc` before executing
  - Root cause: Node.js hooks ran as separate processes without inheriting environment variables
  - Memory auto-load was failing silently with "Learning disabled" or "Missing Supabase config"
  - Added `source .envrc` to SessionStart, PostToolUse (Write|Edit), and Stop hooks

#### How It Works Now
```bash
# Before (broken)
node "hooks/session-start.cjs"  # No env vars!

# After (fixed)
if [ -f .envrc ]; then set -a; source .envrc; set +a; fi; node "hooks/session-start.cjs"
```

## [1.10.0] - 2026-01-08

### Memory Auto-Load from Supabase

Learned patterns and insights now automatically load at session start!

#### Added

  - Queries Supabase for learned patterns at session start
  - Caches results to `.claude/cache/memory-context.md`
  - 1-hour cache TTL, auto-refreshes when stale
  - Non-blocking (fails gracefully if Supabase unavailable)

- **Memory environment variables**
  - `AF_MEMORY_LOADED` - true/false
  - `AF_MEMORY_COUNT` - number of items loaded
  - `AF_MEMORY_ERROR` - error message if failed

- **Memory status in banner**
  - Shows `Memory: X items loaded` in first response
  - Shows `Memory: X items (cached)` when using cache

#### Updated
- **`session-start.cjs`** v1.1.0 - Now calls memory loader
- **`agent-identification-banner.md`** v1.10.0 - Added memory status section
- **`LEARNING_SYSTEM.md`** v1.10.0 - Documented auto-load feature
- **`CLAUDE.md`** - Added memory loading to session start steps

#### How It Works
```
Session Start
    │
    ├── 1. Check env vars
    ├── 2. Load memory from Supabase (NEW!)
    │      └── Caches to .claude/cache/memory-context.md
    ├── 3. Show banner with memory status
    └── ... rest of session start
```

## [1.8.1] - 2026-01-02

### Fix: Auto-Continue Phases Being Skipped

Fixed documentation inconsistency where auto-continue phases were being skipped entirely instead of executing and showing deliverables.

#### Fixed
- **`rules/approval-gates.md`** - Updated to v2.0.0
  - Clarified 2-gate workflow (Phase 2 & 5b only)
  - Auto-continue phases now clearly defined: Execute → Show → Continue
  - Added "Common Mistakes to Avoid" section
  - Removed old 9-gate language

- **`rules/execution-rules.md`** - Updated to v2.0.0
  - Split phase completion rules into Approval vs Auto-Continue
  - Clarified NEVER rules: "Skip auto-continue phases entirely" is forbidden
  - Added Phase Behavior Summary quick reference

- **`rules/safety-rules.md`** - Updated approval gates section
  - Shows 2-gate model with auto-continue phases

Auto-continue ≠ Skip!

Approval Phases (2, 5b):     Execute → Show → WAIT → User approves → Continue
Auto-Continue Phases:        Execute → Show → Continue automatically
Auto-Stop (on blockers):     Execute → Issue found → STOP for fix
```
