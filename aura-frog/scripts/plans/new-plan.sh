## Naming convention

Every node is a folder named `{ID}_{kebab-slug}` containing a `<tier>.md` file (e.g. `feature.md`, `story.md`). The slug is `slugify(intent)`, capped at 50 chars.

| Tier | ID prefix | Folder name | Spec file |
|---|---|---|---|
| T0 | `MISSION` (singleton) | `mission/` (no slug — only one mission) | `mission.md` |
| T1 | `INIT-NNN` (optional) | `initiatives/{ID}_{slug}/` | `initiative.md` |
| T2 | `FEAT-N` or ticket-ID | `features/{ID}_{slug}/` (top-level) OR `features/<PARENT>/subfeatures/{ID}_{slug}/` (nested) | `feature.md` |
| T3 | `STORY-NNNN` | `features/<feature-path>/stories/{ID}_{slug}/` | `story.md` |
| T4 | `TASK-NNNNN` | `features/<feature-path>/stories/<story>/tasks/{ID}_{slug}/` | `task.md` |

If a JIRA / Linear / GitHub ticket ID is attached to a feature, use it as the prefix (e.g. `JIRA-1234_login-redesign/`). Otherwise plan-orchestrator mints `FEAT-N`.

**Initiative tier is optional.** Small / solo-dev projects often skip T1 entirely — features can have `parent: MISSION` directly. Larger efforts use T1 to group features by quarter / OKR / theme. Use whichever fits.

**Subfeatures (T2 recursion).** When a feature is too coarse for one decomposition pass, split it into child features instead of stories. The child sits at `features/<parent-folder>/subfeatures/{ID}_{slug}/feature.md` with `parent: <PARENT_FEAT_ID>` in its frontmatter. Use this when 5+ stories would belong to one feature — promoting some of those story-groups into subfeatures keeps the tree readable.

## How to read a node folder

1. Start with the spec file (`mission.md` / `initiative.md` / `feature.md` / `story.md` / `task.md`).
2. Check the frontmatter: `id`, `tier`, `parent`, `status`, `intent`, `children: [...]`, `revision`.
3. For feature folders: if `## Runs` section is non-empty, scroll there to see `/run` invocations and their run-state.json paths.
4. Per-node aux dirs:
   - `checkpoints/` — pre-mutation snapshots (each file is `{ISO8601}.json`). Drives `/aura-frog:plan undo`.
   - `trace.jsonl` (task folders only) — append-only Claude tool-call events. Source of `/aura-frog:trace`.
5. Per-feature deliverables (`REQUIREMENTS.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `TEST_PLAN.md`) are scaffolded by `/run` Phase 1 when a Standard/Deep run anchors to the feature.
6. Walk into child folders for decomposition (`stories/`, `tasks/`).

## Commands

```bash
/aura-frog:plan                          # bootstrap T0/T1/T2 (interview)
/aura-frog:plan expand FEAT-A            # decompose one tier down
/aura-frog:plan next                     # claim next ready T4
/aura-frog:plan status                   # render tree
/run feature: FEAT-A "task description"  # anchor a new run to this feature
/run resume FEAT-A                       # list + resume runs under this feature
```

## Run ↔ Feature linking

Two-sided:

* `run-state.json` carries `feature_id` and `feature_slug` so a run knows its feature.
* `feature.md` body has a `## Runs` section listing every `/run` invocation that anchored here.

Update both ends through `run-orchestrator` (writes both on Step 0b) and `scripts/plans/link-run.sh` (helper invoked when a run starts or finishes).

## Legacy location

Pre-v3.7.3 used `.aura/plans/`. If you have content there, migrate via:

```bash
mv .aura/plans .claude/plans
```

Or override via `AF_PLANS_DIR=.aura/plans` to keep using the old location. The legacy fallback is removed in v4.0.
