# Aura Frog Pre-flight: path safety
# Reject path traversals (../../../etc/passwd) and absolute paths outside the repo
# (except known-safe dirs: /tmp, /var/tmp, the user's home).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — pass
#   1 — warn (path is suspicious but allowed; warn user)
#   2 — fail (block — clear traversal or hostile target)
#
# Usage:
#   check-path-safety.sh <path>
#   echo "$CLAUDE_TOOL_ARGS" | check-path-safety.sh --from-tool-args
