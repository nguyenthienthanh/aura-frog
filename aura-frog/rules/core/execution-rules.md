# Execution Rules

**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Updated:** v1.8.0

---

## ALWAYS

```toon
always[10]{rule}:
  Load project context before any task
  Detect appropriate agent
  Read command definition — follow exact steps
  Follow phase order (phases build on each other)
  Execute pre/post phase hooks
  Run ESLint/TSLint + TypeScript check after implementation — fix ALL issues
  Show deliverables at phase completion
  Save workflow state
  Approval phases (1 & 3): show gate → WAIT for explicit approval
  Auto-continue phases (2, 4, 5): execute fully → show deliverables → continue
```

## NEVER

```toon
never[13]{rule}:
  Auto-commit without explicit user confirmation (show files + message then ask)
  Auto-push without explicit user confirmation
  Commit credentials/tokens
  Push to main/master without approval
  Write to external systems without confirmation
  Skip project context loading
  Ignore approval gates at Phase 1 & 3
  Skip auto-continue phases (must execute and show deliverables)
  Implement without tests (TDD mandatory)
  Skip RED phase in TDD
  Ignore linter errors
  Leave any/unknown types (TypeScript strictness)
  Let builder agent lead its own review (builder ≠ reviewer — see cross-review-workflow.md)
```

---

## Plan Mode

Use Claude Code's native plan mode for Quick/Standard tasks (brainstorm, design, evaluate).
For Deep complexity: use `workflow:start` for structured 5-phase TDD.

---

## Blocking Conditions

Stop execution on: user rejection, tests failing, coverage below target, linter errors, security vulnerabilities, token limit approaching (150K), external system errors, missing credentials.

## Auto-Continue

After approval, continue until: next approval gate, blocking condition, workflow complete (Phase 5), user interruption, or token limit.

---

## Exception Handling

**Priority:** Project rules > Plugin rules > Generic rules

**User requests skip:** Check if allowed → Document reason → Proceed or explain why not.

**Token limit (150K):** Warn → Suggest handoff → Auto-save state.

---

## Team Mode (Agent Teams)

**When:** `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` enabled.

```toon
team_gate[4]{complexity,domains,mode,cost}:
  Quick,any,single agent,1x
  Standard,any,subagent,1x
  Deep,1 domain,subagent,1x
  Deep,2+ domains (≥50 each),team,~3x
```

Team mode ONLY for Deep + multi-domain. If agent-detector returns `Mode: subagent`, do NOT create a team.

**Startup:** TeamCreate → TaskCreate × N (one message) → Task × N (parallel) → teammates work independently.

```toon
team_always[6]{rule}:
  Max 3 teammates per phase
  Pass complete context to teammates
  Use TaskCreate for all work items
  Claim files before editing via TaskUpdate
  Use SendMessage for handoffs
  Spawn teammates in parallel (one message)

team_never[5]{rule}:
  Team mode for Quick/Standard tasks
  Teammates commit independently (only lead manages git)
  Skip file claiming
  Create more than 3 teammates per phase
  Teammates advance phases (only lead manages transitions)
```
