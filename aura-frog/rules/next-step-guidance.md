# Rule: Next Step Guidance

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Enforcement:** EVERY response must include next step guidance
**Applies To:** All interactions, phases, and approval gates

---

## Core Rule

**EVERY response MUST end with a "What's Next" section showing available actions and suggested commands.**

The user should NEVER have to guess what they can do next.

---

## Guidance Block Format

### Standard Format (End of Every Response)

```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💡 WHAT'S NEXT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Quick Actions:**
• `approve` or `yes` - Continue to next phase
• `reject: <reason>` - Redo with feedback
• `skip` - Skip current phase (if allowed)

**Available Commands:**
• `workflow:status` - Show current progress
• `workflow:skip phase-3` - Skip specific phase
• `workflow:force phase-5` - Jump to phase
• `workflow:pause` - Save and pause
• `workflow:handoff` - Prepare session handoff

**Suggestions:**
→ Type `approve` to continue to Phase 4
→ Or provide feedback to refine the design
```

## Context-Aware Guidance

### Phase 1 (Understand) - After Delivery

```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💡 WHAT'S NEXT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Your Options:**
• `approve` - Accept requirements, move to Design
• `reject: <feedback>` - Refine requirements understanding
• `modify: <changes>` - Adjust specific items

**Quick Commands:**
• `skip brainstorming` - Skip to technical design directly
• `add requirement: <text>` - Add missing requirement
• `clarify: <question>` - Ask clarifying question

**Suggested Next:**
→ Review the requirements above
→ Type `approve` to proceed to Phase 2 (Design)
```

### Phase 2 (Design) - After Delivery

```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💡 WHAT'S NEXT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Your Options:**
• `approve` - Accept design, move to UI/Test Plan
• `reject: <feedback>` - Rethink architecture
• `modify: <changes>` - Adjust specific decisions

**Quick Commands:**
• `skip phase-3` - Skip UI Breakdown (backend-only)
• `force phase-4` - Jump directly to Test Plan
• `compare: <alternative>` - Evaluate alternative approach

**Phase Skipping:**
• Phase 3 (UI) can be skipped for backend tasks
• Type `skip phase-3` to skip UI breakdown

**Suggested Next:**
→ Review the technical design above
→ Type `approve` to proceed to Phase 3 (UI Breakdown)
→ Or type `skip phase-3` for backend-only tasks
```

### Phase 3 (UI Breakdown) - After Delivery

```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💡 WHAT'S NEXT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Your Options:**
• `approve` - Accept UI specs, move to Test Plan
• `reject: <feedback>` - Redesign components
• `modify: <changes>` - Adjust specific components

**Quick Commands:**
• `force tests` - Jump directly to implementation
• `add component: <name>` - Add missing component
• `simplify` - Request simpler UI approach

**Suggested Next:**
→ Review the component breakdown above
→ Type `approve` to proceed to Phase 4 (Test Plan)
```

### Phase 4 (Test Plan) - After Delivery

```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💡 WHAT'S NEXT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Your Options:**
• `approve` - Accept test plan, start TDD
• `reject: <feedback>` - Revise test strategy
• `modify: <changes>` - Add/remove test cases

**Quick Commands:**
• `force implementation` - Skip to coding (⚠️ skips TDD RED)
• `add tests: <description>` - Add more test cases
• `reduce scope` - Fewer tests, faster implementation

**TDD Workflow Coming:**
After approval, we enter TDD cycle:
• Phase 2: Write failing tests (Test RED)
• Phase 3: Implement code (Build GREEN)
• Phase 4: Refactor + Review

**Suggested Next:**
→ Review the test plan above
→ Type `approve` to start Phase 2 (Test RED)
→ Or type `force implementation` to skip test-first (not recommended)
```

### Phase 2-3 (TDD Implementation) - During TDD

```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💡 WHAT'S NEXT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Current:** Phase 3 (Build GREEN) - Implementing code

**Your Options:**
• `continue` - Keep implementing
• `tests:run` - Run tests to check progress
• `pause` - Save and take a break

**Quick Commands:**
• `skip refactor` - Skip refactoring in Phase 4
• `force review` - Jump to code review now
• `add feature: <desc>` - Expand scope (careful!)

**TDD Status:**
• ✅ RED: 5 failing tests written
• 🔄 GREEN: 3/5 tests passing
• ⏳ REFACTOR: Pending

**Suggested Next:**
→ Continue implementing until all tests pass
→ Then type `continue` to move to Phase 4 (Refactor + Review)
```

### Phase 4 (Refactor + Review) - After Delivery

```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💡 WHAT'S NEXT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Your Options:**
• `approve` - Accept code, proceed to finalize
• `reject: <issues>` - Fix issues, re-review
• `approve with notes: <notes>` - Accept with minor fixes

**Quick Commands:**
• `fix: <issue>` - Fix specific issue
• `ignore: <item>` - Skip non-critical issue
• `force finalize` - Skip remaining fixes

**Review Summary:**
• 🔒 Security: ✅ Passed
• ⚡ Performance: ✅ Passed
• 🧹 Code Quality: ⚠️ 2 minor issues
• 🧪 Test Coverage: ✅ 87%

**Suggested Next:**
→ Review the code review findings above
→ Type `approve` to proceed to Phase 5 (Finalize)
→ Or `fix: <issue>` to address specific items
```

### Phase 5 (Finalize - Documentation, Notification)

```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💡 WHAT'S NEXT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Your Options:**
• `approve` - Complete workflow
• `reject: <reason>` - Redo finalize phase
• `done` - Complete workflow now (skip remaining)

**Quick Commands:**
• `skip docs` - Skip documentation
• `skip share` - Skip Slack notification
• `force complete` - End workflow immediately

**Suggested Next:**

→ Type `approve` to complete
→ Or `done` to complete the workflow
```

## When to Show Extended Guidance

### Show FULL guidance when:
- First interaction of a phase
- After rejection (show how to proceed)
- User seems stuck (no response for long text)
- Complex decision point
- Multiple valid paths exist

### Show MINIMAL guidance when:
- Mid-phase work (just "continue" option)
- Simple confirmation needed
- User is clearly flowing

### Minimal Format:

```markdown
---
💡 **Next:** `approve` to continue | `reject: <feedback>` to revise
```

---

## Enforcement Checklist

Every response should:

- [ ] End with guidance block
- [ ] Show 2-3 most relevant options
- [ ] Include at least one quick command
- [ ] Show a clear suggested action
- [ ] Be context-aware for current phase

---

## Error Guidance

When errors occur, show recovery options:

```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️ ERROR: Tests failing (3 failures)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Recovery Options:**
• `fix` - Attempt to fix failing tests
• `show failures` - See detailed error messages
• `skip test: <name>` - Skip specific failing test
• `force continue` - Continue anyway (⚠️ risky)
• `rollback` - Revert to last working state

**Suggested:**
→ Type `show failures` to see what's wrong
→ Then type `fix` to attempt auto-fix
```

---

## Non-Workflow Interactions

For non-workflow tasks, still provide guidance:

```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💡 WHAT'S NEXT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Options:**
• Ask a follow-up question
• Request code changes
• Start a workflow: `workflow:start <task>`

**Quick Commands:**
• `explain: <topic>` - Get explanation
• `show: <file>` - View file contents
• `search: <term>` - Search codebase
• `test:run` - Run tests
• `lint:fix` - Fix linting issues

**Workflows:**
• `workflow:start <feature>` - Start full workflow
• `bugfix:quick <issue>` - Quick bug fix
• `refactor: <target>` - Refactoring task
```
