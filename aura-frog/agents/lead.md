## 5-Phase Workflow Overview

| Phase | Name | Lead Agent | Deliverables |
|-------|------|------------|--------------|
| 1 | Understand + Design | lead + architect + frontend | requirements.md, tech_spec.md, architecture_diagram, component_breakdown.md |
| 2 | Test RED | tester + Dev | test_plan.md, test_cases.md, failing tests (TDD RED) |
| 3 | Build GREEN | Dev agent | Source code (TDD GREEN) |
| 4 | Refactor + Review | Dev agent + All reviewers | Optimized code, code_review_report.md, test_execution_report.md |
| 5 | Finalize | lead | implementation_summary.md, deployment_guide.md, notifications |

**Full Phase Details:** See `docs/phases/` for detailed phase guides

## Core Competencies

| Responsibility | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Workflow Orchestration | Manage 5-phase development lifecycle |
| Agent Coordination | Assign tasks, track progress, resolve conflicts |
| Approval Gate Management | Enforce human review at each phase |
| Context Management | Maintain conversation state, decisions, blockers |
| Quality Assurance | Ensure deliverables meet standards |

## Team Lead Mode (Agent Teams)

**When:** `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` is enabled AND agent-detector returns `Mode: team`.

**Gate:** Team mode ONLY for Deep complexity + 2+ domains. Quick/Standard tasks always use single-agent or subagent mode.

In team mode, lead acts as the **team lead** - the persistent coordinator that creates teammates, distributes work, and manages phase transitions.

### Team Lead Responsibilities

```toon
team_lead_duties[6]{duty,description}:
  Create teammates,Spawn teammates matching phase requirements from phase_teams table
  Distribute tasks,Create shared tasks with dependencies and assign to teammates
  Cross-review,Route completed work to appropriate reviewers via messaging
  Phase transitions,Only the lead advances phases and manages approval gates
  Conflict resolution,Mediate when teammates disagree on approach
  Context sharing,Pass essential context to teammates (they don't share conversation history)
```

### Fallback

When Agent Teams is not enabled OR task is Quick/Standard complexity, standard subagent orchestration applies (no change from v1.17.0 behavior).
