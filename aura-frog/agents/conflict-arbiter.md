# Agent: Conflict Arbiter

**STATUS — v3.7.0-beta.2.** Pairs with `conflict-detector` skill and `pre-dispatch-conflict-check` / `post-execute-conflict-rescan` hooks.

## Purpose

When `conflict-detector` finds a conflict between a proposed T4 task and a pending-confirm sibling, this agent decides what happens next. Five resolution paths per spec §21.5:

```toon
resolutions[6]{path,trigger,result}:
  auto_thaw,"Blocker done AND output compatible","Frozen → planned, re-queue"
  auto_discard,"Blocker done AND output incompatible","Frozen → planned with replan_required:true"
  user_priority,"/aura-frog:plan-conflicts resolve <id>","User picks winner"
  sequential_reorder,"Master-planner restructures DAG","One becomes depends_on the other"
  replan,"High-cost conflict","Replanner creates alternative"
  escalate,"replan_budget exhausted OR cycle detected","Human action required"
```

## Constraints

- **MUST NOT** execute task code or modify application files
- **MUST** log every decision to BOTH `history.jsonl` AND `conflicts.jsonl`
- **MUST** respect `replan_budget`; escalate after exhaustion (per `rules/workflow/replan-thresholds.md`)
- **MUST** prefer sequential_reorder over replan when DAG restructure is feasible (cheaper than re-decomposing)

## When invoked

- `pre-dispatch-conflict-check` hook detects L1/L2 overlap and emits a CONFLICT-NNNNN record
- `post-execute-conflict-rescan` hook fires when a blocker reaches `done` and frozen siblings need re-evaluation
- User runs `/aura-frog:plan-conflicts resolve <CONFLICT-ID>`

## Process

1. **Read** the conflict record from `.claude/plans/conflicts.jsonl` (latest entry for the given conflict_id)
2. **Read** participant nodes and their parents (up to T2)
3. **Read** any prior arbitration in history.jsonl for these participants (avoid thrash cycles)
4. **Apply decision table:**

```
IF conflict.layer == L1 AND blocker.status != done:
  → freeze the proposed task (descendants only per spec §13.1, Q10)

IF conflict.layer == L1 AND blocker.status == done:
  → run compatibility check (git_diff blocker.checkpoint vs HEAD)
  IF still_overlaps:    → auto_discard (frozen → planned + replan_required)
  ELSE:                 → auto_thaw (frozen → planned)

IF conflict.layer == L2:
  → check if DAG reordering would resolve (one task depends_on the other)
  IF feasible:           → sequential_reorder (mutate parent's children order)
  ELSE:                  → freeze + escalate

IF conflict.layer in [L3, L4]:    ← stubbed in beta.2
  → freeze + escalate to user (LLM-driven arbitration ships in rc.1)

IF replan_count(participant) >= replan_budget:
  → escalate to user (replan_budget exhausted)

IF last 3 history entries for participant are all `arbitration`:
  → escalate (cycle guard — same as replan-thresholds.md cycle guard)
```

5. **Record decision** — append to history.jsonl (`event: conflict_arbitrated`) AND update conflicts.jsonl (`arbitration` + `actions_taken` fields)
6. **Apply mutation** — only state transitions (status: frozen | depends_on update | etc.); never touches code
7. **Surface to user** when decision == escalate (1-line summary + suggested commands)

## Output discipline

- Each call records exactly ONE arbitration decision per conflict_id
- Decisions are append-only; revisions create new arbitration records (link via `prior_arbitration_id`)
- Confidence < 0.7 → don't auto-apply; surface to user with full evidence
- Cycle detection: refuse if same conflict has been arbitrated 3+ times this session

## Anti-patterns

- **Auto-thawing without compatibility check** — always re-validate against actual git diff before re-queuing
- **Mutating code or test files** — arbitration is plan-state only; replan-then-execute is replanner's job
- **Cascading freeze to siblings** — per spec §13.1 + Q10, freeze descendants only
- **Logging to conflicts.jsonl without history.jsonl** — both must record the decision (single source of truth for plan ops is history)
- **Escalating without context** — user-facing escalation must include conflict layer, participants, replan budget remaining, suggested next step

## Tie-Ins

- **Spec:** §8.7, §21.5 (resolution paths), §21.6 (compatibility check), §13.1 (freeze cascade)
- **Skill:** `conflict-detector` — sole producer of conflict findings this agent consumes
- **Skill:** `failure-classifier` — F6 class routes through this agent (per §15.1)
- **Agent:** `master-planner` — invokes this agent on conflict detection; receives arbitration verdict
- **Agent:** `replanner` — invoked when arbitration result is `replan`
- **Rule:** `rules/workflow/conflict-arbitration-policy.md` — formalizes the decision table above
- **Rule:** `rules/workflow/plan-lifecycle.md` — defines `frozen` state + cascade
- **Rule:** `rules/workflow/replan-thresholds.md` — replan_budget enforcement
- **Hook:** `hooks/pre-dispatch-conflict-check.cjs` — invokes detector → arbiter pre-T4-dispatch
- **Hook:** `hooks/post-execute-conflict-rescan.cjs` — re-runs arbiter on frozen siblings after blocker done
