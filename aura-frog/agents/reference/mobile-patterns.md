# Mobile Agent - Reference Patterns

**Source:** `agents/mobile.md`
**Load:** On-demand when deep mobile expertise needed

## Performance Targets (Non-Negotiable)

```toon
performance_gates[5]{metric,target,tool}:
  Cold Start,<2s to first content,Flipper/Systrace
  Frame Rate,60fps constant (16.67ms/frame),Perf Monitor
  JS Thread,No blocking operations,Flipper
  Memory,<200MB active usage,Xcode/Android Studio
  Touch Response,<100ms visual feedback,Manual testing
```

**FAIL the build if animations drop below 60fps.**

## Mobile UX Requirements

### Touch Targets (Non-Negotiable)

```toon
touch_targets[4]{element,minimum_size,spacing}:
  Primary buttons,48x48dp,8dp between
  Secondary buttons,44x44dp,8dp between
  List items,48dp height,No spacing needed
  Icons/links,44x44dp touch area,Even if icon is 24px
```

### Thumb Zones (One-Handed Use)

```toon
thumb_zones[3]{zone,position,use_for}:
  Easy (green),Bottom 40%,Primary actions + FAB + navigation
  Medium (yellow),Middle 40%,Content + secondary actions
  Hard (red),Top 20%,Rarely used + close + overflow menus
```

**Primary CTA at bottom of screen within thumb reach.**

---

## Platform Conventions

```toon
ios_patterns[6]{element,pattern}:
  Navigation,Large titles + back text + swipe-to-go-back
  Tab bar,Bottom (max 5) + labels always visible
  Buttons,System blue #007AFF + SF Symbols
  Modals,Sheet from bottom + swipe down to dismiss
  Destructive actions,Red text + confirmation sheet
  Haptics,UIImpactFeedbackGenerator on significant actions
```

```toon
android_patterns[6]{element,pattern}:
  Navigation,Top app bar + NavigationDrawer or BottomNav
  FAB,Bottom right + primary action + ripple
  Buttons,Filled/Outlined/Text + Material You colors
  Modals,Full-screen or bottom sheet + scrim
  Snackbars,Bottom + action button + auto-dismiss (4s)
  Haptics,HapticFeedbackConstants on key interactions
```

---

## Implementation Patterns

**Lists:** Use FlashList for large lists with `estimatedItemSize`. Memoize `renderItem` with `useCallback`. Never use `ScrollView` with `.map()` for lists.

**Navigation:** Type-safe with `RootStackParamList` typing on `useNavigation`.

**Animations:** Use Reanimated (`useSharedValue`, `withSpring`, `useAnimatedStyle`). Use Gesture Handler for gestures. 60fps required.

**Loading states:** Skeleton screens matching content layout. Pull-to-refresh for lists. Haptic feedback on significant actions.

## Quality Checklist (Every PR)

Touch targets >=48dp primary/>=44dp secondary. Primary actions in bottom 40%. 60fps verified. Skeleton loaders match content. Error states have retry. Haptic feedback on key interactions. Tested on both iOS and Android. Swipe gestures work (back, dismiss, refresh).
