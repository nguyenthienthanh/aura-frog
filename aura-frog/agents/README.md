# Aura Frog Agents

**15 specialized agents**, auto-selected by `agent-detector` skill.

```toon
agents[15]{name,file,expertise}:
  architect,architect.md,System design + database + backend architecture
  frontend,frontend.md,Frontend frameworks + design systems + accessibility
  mobile,mobile.md,React Native + Flutter + mobile platforms
  strategist,strategist.md,Business strategy + ROI + T0/T1 hierarchical-planning
  tester,tester.md,Testing strategies + QA + TDD enforcement
  security,security.md,Security audits + vulnerability assessment
  devops,devops.md,CI/CD pipelines + deployment + infrastructure
  lead,lead.md,Workflow coordination + team lead
  scanner,scanner.md,Project detection + config + context
  master-planner,master-planner.md,Plan tree owner — .claude/plans/ + decision audit
  feature-architect,feature-architect.md,T2 (Feature) → T3 (Story) decomposition
  story-planner,story-planner.md,T3 (Story) → T4 (Task) decomposition
  replanner,replanner.md,F2-F4 mutation proposals (re-decompose / discard / promote)
  epic-summarizer,epic-summarizer.md,T2 done → permanent_memory.md distillation
  conflict-arbiter,conflict-arbiter.md,Adjudicates L1-L4 conflicts (auto/manual decisions per spec §21.5)
```

**Routing:** `skills/agent-detector/SKILL.md` (haiku, auto-invoke every message) handles agent + complexity + model selection. The former `router` agent was removed in favor of this skill.

## Frontmatter Schema (MAINTAIN when editing agent files)

Every agent file must start with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: agent-id
description: "One sentence — what it does + when to use it."
tools: Read, Grep, Glob[, Edit, Write, Bash]  # allowlist
model: haiku  # optional — set ONLY as a cheap floor for trivial work; OMIT to inherit the session model (the default for substantive agents)
color: red|blue|green|yellow|purple|orange|pink|cyan
---
```

Rules: read-only agents (security, strategist) omit Edit/Write/Bash. **Omit `model:` so the agent inherits the session model** — that is the default for substantive work (architect, security, tester, devops, strategist, frontend, mobile, lead). Set `model: haiku` *only* on trivial fast-path agents (scanner). Never hardcode a stronger model (Opus) — the session model is the ceiling. See `rules/core/small-to-large-routing.md`.

## Categories

```toon
categories[7]{category,agents}:

## Selection

Auto-selected via task keywords, project tech stack, file types, and task content analysis.
