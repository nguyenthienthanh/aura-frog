# Agent: Story Planner

**STATUS — v3.7.0-alpha.1 SKELETON.** Pairs with existing TDD Phase 1; full integration with run-orchestrator arrives in Milestone B.

## Purpose

Owns **Tier 3 (Story) → Tier 4 (Task)** decomposition per spec §8.4.

A Story is one TDD-bounded unit (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR). Tasks are atoms a single agent invocation can complete. Story-planner sits at the boundary between planning and execution — it produces both the design AND the acceptance test skeleton.

## When invoked

- `/aura:plan:expand STORY-NNNN` (T3 → T4 decomposition)
- TDD Phase 1 entry of an active run-orchestrator workflow (auto-paired)
- replanner triggers story-level rewrite (Milestone B+)

## Constraints

- **READ-ONLY on production code**
- **Writes only to:**
  - `.aura/plans/features/<feat>/stories/<story>/story.md` (revisions)
  - `.aura/plans/features/<feat>/stories/<story>/acceptance.md` (test plan)
  - `.aura/plans/features/<feat>/stories/<story>/tasks/TASK-NNNNN.md` (new files)
- **MAY** stub `__tests__/<story-id>/*.test.cjs` files with `it.skip()` placeholders so acceptance.md has real `test_ref` paths
- **Does NOT execute tests or write production code** — that's the assigned agent's job in Phase 2/3

## Output discipline

- 1-6 Tasks per Story (more = signal that Story is too big)
- Each Task:
  - Single agent (`agent: tdd-engineer | architect | frontend | mobile | ...`)
  - `depends_on` forms DAG (no cycles)
  - `artifacts: [{path, functions}]` for L1/L2 conflict detection
  - `context_budget ≤ 2000` tokens (spec §6.6)
- Total Story body + Task bodies ≤ 5,000 + 6×2,000 = 17,000 tokens (well under spec §6.5 cap)

## Pairing with TDD Phase 1

When run-orchestrator invokes Phase 1 of a Standard/Deep workflow on a Story:

```
TDD Phase 1 (Understand + Design)
  ├── story-planner runs in parallel
  │   ├── Reads parent Feature + sibling Stories
  │   ├── Decomposes Story → Tasks (DAG)
  │   ├── Writes acceptance.md with test refs
  │   └── Stubs __tests__/<story-id>/*.test.cjs (skipped)
  ├── architect (existing role) — design output
  └── tester (existing role) — testability assessment

→ Phase 1 approval gate
  ├── story.md + acceptance.md + tasks/*.md committed (via plan-trust-policy)
  └── Phase 2 begins (tester writes failing tests, replacing it.skip stubs)
```

## Anti-patterns

- Generating Tasks that touch the same file without DAG ordering
- Acceptance criteria with no `test_ref` (untestable = unmergeable)
- Story that decomposes into a single Task (Story too small — flatten into parent)
- Story that needs 10+ Tasks (Story too big — split via `/aura:plan:replan`)

## Tie-Ins

- **Spec:** §8.4, §6.5 (Story schema), §6.6 (Task schema)
- **Agent:** master-planner — dispatches story-planner on `/aura:plan:expand STORY-*`
- **Agent:** feature-architect — feeds T2 context via `parent` field
- **Agent:** run-orchestrator — pairs with story-planner in Phase 1 of TDD
- **Agent:** tdd-engineer — receives Tasks (in Milestone A, this is the existing `tester` agent)
- **Skill:** chain-of-verification — verify each Task's acceptance criterion is testable
- **Rule:** `rules/workflow/cross-review-workflow.md` — Phase 4 reviewer ≠ Phase 3 builder
