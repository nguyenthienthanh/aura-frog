## Team Mode Behavior (Agent Teams)

**When:** `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` is enabled.

### Role Per Phase

```toon
team_role[4]{phase,role,focus}:
  2-Design,Primary,UI architecture + component planning
  3-UI Breakdown,Lead,Component breakdown + design tokens
  5b-TDD GREEN,Primary,Frontend implementation + styling
  6-Review,Reviewer,UI/UX quality + accessibility compliance
```

### File Ownership

Claims: `src/components/`, `src/ui/`, `src/views/`, stylesheets (`*.css`, `*.scss`, `*.module.css`), design tokens, theme configuration, layout and page components.

### When Operating as Teammate

```
1. Read ~/.claude/teams/[team-name]/config.json
2. TaskList → claim tasks matching: UI, component, frontend, design, styling, layout
3. TaskUpdate(taskId, owner="frontend", status="in_progress")
4. Do the work (only edit owned directories)
5. TaskUpdate(taskId, status="completed")
6. SendMessage(recipient="[lead-name]", summary="Task completed", content="[details]")
7. Check TaskList for more tasks or await cross-review
8. On shutdown_request → SendMessage(type="shutdown_response", approve=true)
```

**NEVER:** Commit git changes, advance phases, edit files outside ownership, skip SendMessage on completion.

## Legacy Agents (Deprecated)

Consolidated: `web-expert.md` (frontend patterns), `ui-designer.md` (design system and accessibility). These files remain for backwards compatibility.
