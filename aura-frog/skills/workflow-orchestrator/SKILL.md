# Aura Frog Workflow Orchestrator

**Priority:** CRITICAL - Use for complex feature implementations
**Version:** 1.20.1

---

## When to Use

**USE for:**
- New features
- Complex implementations
- Tasks > 2 hours
- Multi-file changes
- Tasks requiring TDD workflow

**DON'T use for:**
- Bug fixes → use `bugfix-quick`
- Quick refactors → direct edit
- Config changes → direct edit
- Simple questions → just answer

---

## Pre-Execution Checklist

1. **agent-detector** → Select lead agent (MANDATORY)
2. **project-context-loader** → Load conventions (MANDATORY)
3. **Show agent banner** at start of response
4. **Verify task complexity** - if simple, suggest lighter approach

---

## Token Budget Per Phase

**CRITICAL:** Stay within budget to avoid context explosion.

```toon
token_budget[9]{phase,max_tokens,format}:
  1,500,TOON summary only - NO prose
  2,1500,Technical design in TOON + minimal prose
  3,800,Component list in TOON
  4,600,Test cases in TOON table
  5a,1000,Test code only - no explanations
  5b,2000,Implementation code - minimal comments
  5c,500,Refactor summary in TOON
  6,800,Review findings in TOON table
  7-9,300 each,Status only
```

**Phase 1 HARD CAP: 500 tokens.** Use `/workflow:phase1-lite` format.

---

## 9-Phase Workflow

| Phase | Name | Lead Agent | Deliverable | Gate |
|-------|------|------------|-------------|------|
| 1 | Understand 🎯 | pm-operations-orchestrator | Requirements (TOON, ≤500 tokens) | ⚡ Auto |
| 2 | Design 🏗️ | Dev agent | Technical design | ✋ **Approval** |
| 3 | UI Breakdown 🎨 | ui-expert | Component breakdown | ⚡ Auto |
| 4 | Plan Tests 🧪 | qa-automation | Test strategy | ⚡ Auto |
| 5a | Write Tests 🔴 | qa-automation + Dev | Failing tests (TDD RED) | ⚡ Auto |
| 5b | Build 🟢 | Dev agent | Implementation (TDD GREEN) | ✋ **Approval** |
| 5c | Polish ♻️ | Dev agent | Refactored code (TDD REFACTOR) | ⚡ Auto |
| 6 | Review 👀 | security-expert | Quality review report | ⚡ Auto* |
| 7 | Verify ✅ | qa-automation | All tests pass, coverage ≥80% | ⚡ Auto |
| 8 | Document 📚 | pm-operations-orchestrator | Documentation | ⚡ Auto |
| 9 | Share 🔔 | slack-operations | Team notification | ⚡ Auto |

**Gate Legend:**
- ✋ **Approval** = Must wait for user approval before continuing
- ⚡ Auto = Auto-continue after showing deliverables
- ⚡ Auto* = Auto-continue unless issues found (stops if critical issues)

---

## Phase Transition Rules

### Valid Transitions

```
Phase 1 (Understand) → Phase 2 (Design)
  Mode: ⚡ AUTO-CONTINUE
  Shows: Requirements summary, then continues

Phase 2 (Design) → Phase 3 (UI)
  Mode: ✋ APPROVAL REQUIRED
  Blocker: No technical design approved

Phase 3 (UI) → Phase 4 (Plan Tests)
  Mode: ⚡ AUTO-CONTINUE
  Skip if: No UI component in task

Phase 4 (Plan Tests) → Phase 5a (Write Tests)
  Mode: ⚡ AUTO-CONTINUE
  Shows: Test strategy, then continues

Phase 5a (RED) → Phase 5b (GREEN)
  Mode: ⚡ AUTO-CONTINUE (if tests fail as expected)
  Blocker: Tests pass (they should fail!) → STOP

Phase 5b (GREEN) → Phase 5c (REFACTOR)
  Mode: ✋ APPROVAL REQUIRED
  Blocker: Tests still failing

Phase 5c (REFACTOR) → Phase 6 (Review)
  Mode: ⚡ AUTO-CONTINUE (if tests still pass)
  Blocker: Tests broken by refactor → STOP

Phase 6 (Review) → Phase 7 (Verify)
  Mode: ⚡ AUTO-CONTINUE (unless critical issues)
  Blocker: Critical security issues → STOP for approval

Phase 7 (Verify) → Phase 8 (Document)
  Mode: ⚡ AUTO-CONTINUE (if tests pass)
  Blocker: Tests fail or coverage <80% → STOP

Phase 8 (Document) → Phase 9 (Share)
  Mode: ⚡ AUTO-CONTINUE
  Auto-executes Phase 9
```

### Summary: Only 2 Approval Gates

| Gate | Phase | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| 1st | Phase 2 (Design) | Architecture decisions are hard to change later |
| 2nd | Phase 5b (GREEN) | Main implementation - review before refactor |

All other phases auto-continue unless a blocker is hit.

### Invalid Transitions (BLOCKED)

- ❌ Skip from Phase 1 to Phase 5 (no design)
- ❌ Phase 5b without 5a (no TDD)
- ❌ Phase 7 with failing tests
- ❌ Any phase skip without explicit user request

---

## Approval Gates (Only 2)

Approval is only required at **Phase 2 (Design)** and **Phase 5b (Implementation)**.

### Gate Format

```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🏗️ Phase [N]: [Name] - Approval Needed
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## [Friendly Summary] ✨

[Deliverables list]

---

📍 **Progress:** ████░░░░░░░░░░░░ [X]% ([N]/8 phases)

⏭️ **After approval:**
→ Phases [N+1] to [X] will AUTO-CONTINUE
→ Next approval gate: Phase [Y]

---

**Options:**
- `approve` / `yes` → Continue (auto-runs until next gate)
- `reject: <reason>` → Brainstorm & re-do
- `modify: <changes>` → Adjust deliverables
- `stop` → Cancel workflow

⚡ After approval, I'll AUTO-CONTINUE through multiple phases!
```

See: `rules/workflow-navigation.md` for full navigation format.

### Auto-Continue Phases (No Approval Needed)

These phases show deliverables but continue automatically:

| Phase | Shows | Then |
|-------|-------|------|
| 1. Understand | Requirements summary | → Continues to Phase 2 |
| 3. UI Breakdown | Component breakdown | → Continues to Phase 4 |
| 4. Test Plan | Test strategy | → Continues to Phase 5a |
| 5a. TDD RED | Failing tests | → Continues to Phase 5b (if tests fail) |
| 5c. TDD REFACTOR | Cleaned code | → Continues to Phase 6 (if tests pass) |
| 6. Review | Review report | → Continues to Phase 7 (unless critical issues) |
| 7. Verify | Test results | → Continues to Phase 8 (if pass) |
| 8. Document | Documentation | → Continues to Phase 9 |

**Auto-Stop Conditions:**
- Phase 5a: Tests pass (should fail) → STOP
- Phase 5c/6/7: Tests fail → STOP
- Phase 6: Critical security issues → STOP
- Phase 7: Coverage < 80% → STOP

### Valid Responses

| Response | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `approve` / `yes` | Continue to next phase immediately |
| `reject: <reason>` | **Brainstorm first**, then restart phase |
| `modify: <changes>` | **Light brainstorm**, then adjust deliverables |
| `stop` / `cancel` | End workflow, save state |

### Feedback Handling (IMPORTANT)

**Default behavior:** Brainstorm feedback before implementing.
- Analyze user's suggestion
- Consider alternatives
- Present options with pros/cons
- Then implement agreed approach

**Force mode:** Skip brainstorming when user says:
- "must do: ..." → Implement directly
- "just do: ..." → Skip discussion
- "work like that" → No alternatives

See: `rules/feedback-brainstorming.md`

---

## AUTO-CONTINUE Behavior

**Streamlined workflow with only 2 approval gates:**

### Flow Overview
```
START → Phase 1 (auto) → Phase 2 ✋ APPROVAL
      → Phase 3-5a (auto) → Phase 5b ✋ APPROVAL
      → Phase 5c-9 (auto) → DONE
```

### Example Flow
```
User: "workflow:start Add JWT authentication"

→ Phase 1: Understand (shows summary, auto-continues)
→ Phase 2: Design
  ✋ APPROVAL GATE - waits for user

User: "approve"

→ Phase 3: UI Breakdown (auto-continues)
→ Phase 4: Test Plan (auto-continues)
→ Phase 5a: TDD RED - write failing tests (auto-continues if tests fail)
→ Phase 5b: TDD GREEN - implementation
  ✋ APPROVAL GATE - waits for user

User: "approve"

→ Phase 5c: Refactor (auto-continues if tests pass)
→ Phase 6: Review (auto-continues unless critical issues)
→ Phase 7: Verify (auto-continues if tests pass)
→ Phase 8: Document (auto-continues)
→ Phase 9: Share (auto-executes)
→ DONE ✅
```

**Auto-Stop Triggers:**
- Tests fail when they shouldn't (or pass when they should fail)
- Critical security issues in review
- Coverage below 80%
- Token limit reached

**Token Awareness:**
- At 75% (150K tokens): Warn user
- At 85% (170K tokens): Suggest `workflow:handoff`
- At 90% (180K tokens): Force handoff

---

## Critical Rules

### TDD (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

```
Phase 5a (RED):
  ✅ Write tests FIRST
  ✅ Run tests → MUST FAIL
  ❌ If tests pass → STOP, tests aren't testing new code

Phase 5b (GREEN):
  ✅ Write minimal code to pass tests
  ✅ Run tests → MUST PASS
  ❌ If tests fail → Fix code, not tests

Phase 5c (REFACTOR):
  ✅ Clean up code
  ✅ Run tests → MUST STILL PASS
  ❌ If tests fail → Revert refactor
```

### KISS Principle

- ✅ Simple over complex
- ✅ Standard patterns over custom
- ✅ Solve today's problem, not tomorrow's
- ❌ No premature abstraction
- ❌ No over-engineering
- ❌ No excessive configuration

### Cross-Review

| Phase | Creator | Reviewers |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| 1 (Understand) | PM | Dev + QA + UI |
| 2 (Design) | Dev | Secondary Dev + QA |
| 4 (Plan Tests) | QA | Dev |
| 6 (Review) | Security | All |

---

## Phase Skip Rules

### Automatic Skips

- **Phase 3 (UI):** Skip if task has no UI components
- **Phase 9 (Share):** Skip if no Slack integration configured

### User-Requested Skips

User can request skip with reason:
```
User: "skip phase 3, this is backend only"
→ Log skip reason
→ Proceed to Phase 4
```

---

## Files to Load (ON-DEMAND ONLY)

**TOKEN OPTIMIZATION:** Do NOT pre-load all files. Load only when entering that phase.

### Phase Guides (Load ONE at a time)
```toon
phase_files[9]{phase,file,load_when}:
  1,docs/phases/phase-1-understand.md,Entering Phase 1
  2,docs/phases/phase-2-design.md,Entering Phase 2
  3,docs/phases/phase-3-ui.md,Entering Phase 3 (skip if no UI)
  4,docs/phases/phase-4-test-planning.md,Entering Phase 4
  5,docs/phases/phase-5-implementation.md,Entering Phase 5a/5b/5c
  6,docs/phases/phase-6-review.md,Entering Phase 6
  7,docs/phases/phase-7-verification.md,Entering Phase 7
  8,docs/phases/phase-8-documentation.md,Entering Phase 8
  9,docs/phases/phase-9-notification.md,Entering Phase 9
```

### Project Context (Load ONCE at workflow start)
```
.claude/project-contexts/[project]/project-config.yaml
```
**Skip:** conventions.md and rules.md unless explicitly needed.

### Rules (Load only if referenced)
```toon
rules[4]{rule,load_when}:
  tdd-workflow.md,Phase 5 only
  kiss-principle.md,Never (principle is inline above)
  feedback-brainstorming.md,Only on reject/modify response
  workflow-navigation.md,Only if navigation unclear
```

---

## State Management

### Save State
```
workflow:handoff
→ Saves to .claude/logs/workflows/[workflow-id]/
→ Contains: current phase, deliverables, context
```

### Resume State
```
workflow:resume <workflow-id>
→ Loads saved state
→ Continues from last phase
→ Re-shows approval gate if pending
```

### Workflow Status
```
workflow:status
→ Shows: current phase, completed phases, pending tasks
```

## Fast-Track Mode

**When to use:** User provides complete specs/design. Skips phases 1-3, auto-executes 4-9 without approval gates.

**Triggers:** `fasttrack: <specs>` | `workflow:fasttrack <file>` | "just build it"

### Spec Validation (Required Before Start)

```toon
required_sections[6]{section,purpose}:
  Overview,What we're building
  Requirements,Functional requirements
  Technical Design,Architecture/approach
  API/Interfaces,Endpoints or component APIs
  Data Model,Database/state structure
  Acceptance Criteria,Definition of done
```

**If missing sections:** Ask user to provide them.

### Fast-Track Execution

```
Phase 4 → Phase 5a → Phase 5b → Phase 5c → Phase 6 → Phase 7 → Phase 8 → Phase 9
(No approval gates — only stops on errors)
```

### Stop Conditions

| Condition | Phase | Action |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Tests pass in RED | 5a | Stop — specs may be incomplete |
| Tests fail after 3 attempts | 5b | Stop — ask user for clarification |
| Critical security issue | 6 | Stop — fix before proceeding |
| Coverage below 80% | 7 | Add tests, retry twice, then ask |
| Token limit warning | Any | Save state and handoff |

### Switching Modes

```
standard → fasttrack: "approve phase 3, then fasttrack the rest"
fasttrack → standard: On error, auto-switches to standard mode
```

---

## Agent Teams Mode (Experimental)

**When:** `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` is enabled AND complexity = Deep + 2+ domains.

**Gate:** Team mode ONLY activates for Deep complexity with 2+ domains scoring ≥50 each. All Quick and Standard tasks use single-agent or subagent mode to save tokens (~3x cost reduction).

### Parallel Startup Sequence

**This is the concrete sequence the lead agent executes:**

```
Step 1: CREATE TEAM
────────────────────
TeamCreate(team_name="[ticket-or-feature-slug]", description="[task summary]")

Step 2: CREATE TASKS (all in one message)
──────────────────────────────────────────
TaskCreate(subject="[task-1]", description="[full context + files + acceptance criteria]")
TaskCreate(subject="[task-2]", description="[full context + files + acceptance criteria]")
TaskCreate(subject="[task-3]", description="[full context + files + acceptance criteria]")

Step 3: SPAWN TEAMMATES IN PARALLEL (all in one message — this is the key)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Task(team_name="[slug]", name="architect", subagent_type="aura-frog:architect",
     prompt="You are architect on team [slug]. Your role: [phase role].
             Read team config: ~/.claude/teams/[slug]/config.json
             Check TaskList for unclaimed tasks matching your expertise.
             Claim with TaskUpdate(taskId, owner='architect', status='in_progress').
             When done: TaskUpdate(taskId, status='completed') then
             SendMessage(recipient='pm-operations-orchestrator', content='Done: [summary]')
             Files you own: src/api/, src/services/, migrations/")

Task(team_name="[slug]", name="ui-expert", subagent_type="aura-frog:ui-expert",
     prompt="You are ui-expert on team [slug]. Your role: [phase role].
             [same pattern as above]
             Files you own: src/components/, src/ui/, *.css")

Task(team_name="[slug]", name="qa-automation", subagent_type="aura-frog:qa-automation",
     prompt="You are qa-automation on team [slug]. Your role: [phase role].
             [same pattern as above]
             Files you own: tests/, __tests__/, *.test.*")

Step 4: MONITOR + COORDINATE
─────────────────────────────
- Teammates work in parallel on claimed tasks
- Lead receives completion messages via SendMessage
- Lead sends cross-review requests: SendMessage(recipient="qa-automation", content="Review architect's API design")
- TeammateIdle hook auto-assigns idle teammates to cross-review

Step 5: PHASE TRANSITION
─────────────────────────
- Lead validates all phase tasks complete
- Lead shuts down current teammates: SendMessage(type="shutdown_request", recipient="architect")
- Lead spawns new teammate set for next phase (repeat Steps 2-4)
- Single-agent phases (7, 8, 9): lead works alone, no teammates
```

### Phase Team Composition

```toon
phase_teams[11]{phase,lead,primary,secondary,team_size}:
  1-Understand,pm-operations-orchestrator,architect,qa-automation,3
  2-Design,architect,ui-expert,qa-automation,3
  3-UI,ui-expert,mobile-expert,-,2
  4-Test Plan,qa-automation,architect,-,2
  5a-TDD RED,qa-automation,architect,-,2
  5b-TDD GREEN,architect,ui-expert+qa-automation,-,3
  5c-TDD REFACTOR,architect,-,qa-automation(reviewer),2
  6-Review,security-expert,architect+qa-automation,-,3
  7-Verify,qa-automation,-,-,1
  8-Document,pm-operations-orchestrator,-,-,1
  9-Share,pm-operations-orchestrator,-,-,1
```

### Teammate Operation Pattern

Each teammate follows this pattern after being spawned:

```
1. Read ~/.claude/teams/[team-name]/config.json → discover team members
2. TaskList → find unclaimed tasks matching specialization
3. TaskUpdate(taskId, owner="[my-name]", status="in_progress") → claim task
4. Do the work (read files, edit code, run tests)
5. TaskUpdate(taskId, status="completed") → mark done
6. SendMessage(type="message", recipient="[lead]",
     summary="Task completed", content="Completed [task]. Summary: [what was done]")
7. TaskList → check for more unclaimed tasks (repeat from step 3)
8. If no tasks: TeammateIdle hook assigns cross-review or shutdown
```

### Team Token Budgets

```toon
team_token_budget[5]{phase_group,per_teammate,total_budget,notes}:
  Phase 1 (Understand),300,900,Lead summarizes + teammates validate
  Phase 2-4 (Design/UI/Test),1500,4500,Parallel design work
  Phase 5a-5c (TDD),2000,6000,Parallel test writing + implementation
  Phase 6-7 (Review/Verify),1000,3000,Parallel reviews
  Phase 8-9 (Doc/Notify),500,500,Single agent phases
```

### Auto Team Lifecycle (Team-Workflow Bridge)

When teams are active, phase transitions automatically manage team lifecycle:

```
Phase start (pre-phase hook):
  -> team-bridge.cjs create-if-needed
  -> Creates teams/ log dir, registers in workflow-state.json
  -> Lead uses returned team name with TeamCreate()

Phase end (post-phase hook):
  -> team-bridge.cjs teardown (marks team completed)
  -> merge-team-logs.sh --phase N (merges JSONL logs)

Phase rejected:
  -> team-bridge.cjs handle-rejection
  -> Archives logs to -attempt-N, fresh dir for retry

Workflow complete:
  -> merge-team-logs.sh (all phases -> unified-timeline.jsonl)
```

Per-team logs are stored in `teams/phase-{slug}/` as JSONL files (one per agent + combined). Teammates log actions automatically when `AF_TEAM_LOG_DIR` is set in their environment.

**Full docs:** `docs/TEAM_WORKFLOW_BRIDGE.md`

### Team vs Subagent Fallback

If Agent Teams is not enabled OR complexity is not Deep + multi-domain:
- Sequential execution (standard subagent behavior)
- Single context window
- Hub-spoke communication via Task tool
- No additional token overhead

---

**Remember:**
- Follow phases in order
- Only 2 approval gates: Phase 2 (Design) and Phase 5b (Implementation)
- Auto-continue through other phases unless blocker hit
- TDD is mandatory (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- Save state at token limit
- **ALWAYS show what's next** after each phase (see `rules/workflow-navigation.md`)
