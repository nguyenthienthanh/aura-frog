# Plan Orchestrator

Single entry point for the 11-verb hierarchical-planning vocabulary. Routes user intent → backing script in `aura-frog/scripts/plans/`. Replaces 10 separate command files with one consolidated dispatcher.

**Owner command:** `commands/plan.md` (single user-facing command)
**Bare-word router:** `hooks/bare-word-router.cjs` (active-plan vocabulary)
**Data model:** `.claude/plans/` per Tech Spec §6

## verb_table[11]

```toon
verbs[11]{verb,tier_in,tier_out,script,mutates_active_json}:
  bootstrap,—,T0+T1+T2,new-plan.sh,true
  expand,T1/T2/T3,T2/T3/T4,expand-node.sh,false
  next,T3,T4,next-task.sh,true
  status,—,—,render-plan-tree.sh,false
  replan,T1-T4,T1-T4,replan-node.sh,false
  promote,T4,T1/T2,promote-node.sh,false
  archive,T2+,T2+,archive-feature.sh,false
  undo,T1-T4,T1-T4,undo-decision.sh,true
  freeze,T1-T4,T1-T4,freeze-branch.sh,false
  thaw,T1-T4,T1-T4,thaw-branch.sh,false
  conflicts,—,—,conflicts-scan.sh,false
```

`bootstrap` is the unprefixed `/aura-frog:plan` (no verb) — T0/T1/T2 interview. Every other verb requires an explicit target node ID or option flags.

---

## intent_keywords[11]

Used by Stage 2 of the routing pipeline when the user's input has no explicit verb prefix. Match by stemmed substring (case-insensitive).

```toon
keywords[11]{verb,phrases}:
  bootstrap,"plan|bootstrap|set up the plan|init plan|new plan"
  expand,"expand|decompose|break down|drill down|split into stories|split into tasks"
  next,"next|next task|what's next|claim next|dispatch next|pick up"
  status,"status|tree|render|show plan|where are we|progress"
  replan,"replan|rework|reset|redo plan|discard plan|change plan"
  promote,"promote|surface|bubble up|elevate|discovery|insight up"
  archive,"archive|compress|wrap up|finalize feature|close out"
  undo,"undo|rollback|revert|restore|step back"
  freeze,"freeze|pause|halt|park|block|stop work on"
  thaw,"thaw|unfreeze|resume|continue|unblock"
  conflicts,"conflict|collision|overlap|incompatible|conflicts list|conflict check"
```

A user utterance like "let's expand FEAT-A into stories" matches `expand` via `expand|decompose`. "rollback" matches `undo`. "what's next" matches `next`.

---

## 3-stage routing pipeline

When invoked (via `/aura-frog:plan <input>` or bare-word router), execute in order — stop at the first stage that produces a single match.

### Stage 1 — Explicit verb prefix (deterministic)

Pattern: `<verb> [<target_id_or_flags>]` where `<verb>` ∈ verb_table.

Examples:
- `expand FEAT-A` → run `expand-node.sh FEAT-A`
- `next` → run `next-task.sh`
- `freeze TASK-00042 --reason "blocked on db schema"` → run `freeze-branch.sh TASK-00042 --reason "..."`
- `conflicts list --open` → run `conflicts-scan.sh list --open`

If the first token matches a verb in verb_table → dispatch directly. Skip Stage 2/3.

**Legacy command shape support:** If invoked via a `plan-<verb>.md` alias stub (e.g. `/aura-frog:plan-expand FEAT-A`), treat as Stage 1 with the verb implied — the stub file passes the verb explicitly.

### Stage 2 — Intent classification (keyword match)

If Stage 1 doesn't match, scan input against `intent_keywords`. Match each keyword group; collect verbs whose phrases appear in the input.

- **Single match** → run `resolve-node.sh` against any node-shaped token (matches `^(MISSION|INIT|FEAT|STORY|TASK)-[A-Z0-9]+$` OR title substring), then dispatch the matched verb.
- **Multi-match** (e.g. "expand and replan FEAT-A" hits both `expand` + `replan`) → surface to user: `Two intents detected: expand, replan. Run one at a time — which first?`
- **Zero matches** → fall through to Stage 3.

### Stage 3 — LLM fallback (ambiguous)

No explicit verb, no keyword match. Surface a structured prompt:

```
Couldn't auto-route this. The plan vocabulary is: bootstrap, expand, next, status,
replan, promote, archive, undo, freeze, thaw, conflicts. Closest matches: <top 2 by
edit distance>. Reply with a verb or `/aura-frog:plan status` to see the tree.
```

Do not guess. Do not auto-dispatch in Stage 3.

## Node resolution

When a verb takes a `<target>` arg, the target may be:
1. **Full ID** (`FEAT-A`, `TASK-00042`) — exact match required.
2. **Title substring** (`auth-flow`) — case-insensitive substring of the node's `intent:` frontmatter field.
3. **Special tokens** — `--active` resolves to `active.task` from `active.json`. `--feature` resolves to `active.feature`.

Delegate to `scripts/plans/resolve-node.sh <input>` — exit 0 single match, 1 multi-match (print candidates), 2 no match.

---

## Atomicity contract (applies to every mutating verb)

Every backing script that writes a node file must:
1. **Read** the current `.claude/plans/active.json` and target node file.
2. **Save checkpoint** to `.claude/plans/checkpoints/<NODE_ID>.<ISO8601>.json` containing pre-mutation state + git SHA.
3. **Mutate** the target file with `revision += 1`.
4. **Validate** via `bash scripts/plans/validate-plan-tree.sh` — abort + restore checkpoint if any invariant fails.
5. **Append** `history.jsonl` decision event: `{ts, verb, target, before_revision, after_revision, agent}`.
6. **Atomic write** — write to `<file>.tmp`, then `mv` over the target. Never partial-write a node file.

## Backing scripts

| Script | Owner verb | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `new-plan.sh` | bootstrap | Init `.claude/plans/` skeleton (existing, idempotent) |
| `expand-node.sh` | expand | Decompose T2→T3 or T3→T4. Dispatches feature-architect or story-planner agent. |
| `next-task.sh` | next | Pop next ready T4 from `ready_queue`; populate from active T3 if empty. |
| `freeze-branch.sh` | freeze | Cascade-freeze descendants. Save checkpoint, refuse on done/archived. |
| `thaw-branch.sh` | thaw | Reverse freeze. Validate blocker resolved + git-diff compatibility per §21.6. |
| `archive-feature.sh` | archive | Compress completed T2 to summary + move originals to `archive/`. |
| `conflicts-scan.sh` | conflicts | Wrap L1+L2 detection (conflict-detector hook). List/show/resolve/history/check. |
| `replan-node.sh` | replan | Mutate target + descendants. Budget-aware (refuse if `replan_count >= replan_budget`). |
| `promote-node.sh` | promote | Bubble T4 discovery up to T2/T1 — append to `discoveries[]`, increment revision. |
| `undo-decision.sh` | undo | Restore latest `.claude/plans/checkpoints/<id>.*.json` (LIFO). |
| `resolve-node.sh` | (helper) | Resolve `<input>` to node ID. Exit 0/1/2. |

Existing: `new-plan.sh`, `validate-plan-tree.sh`, `render-plan-tree.sh`. All others new in v3.7.2.

## Bare-word activation

When `.claude/plans/active.json` exists, the user may type a verb as the first token of a short message and have it route here. `hooks/bare-word-router.cjs` handles detection; this skill receives the routing hint and dispatches per Stage 1.

Activation conditions (all must hold):
- `.claude/plans/active.json` is present and parseable.
- First token of the user prompt is a member of `verb_table[].verb`.
- Total word count ≤ 5 (so "next" routes but "next steps are unclear" doesn't).

When a verb requires a target but none is given, suggest the most likely:
- `next` → run; needs nothing.
- `expand` → suggest active.feature or active.story.
- `freeze`/`thaw`/`replan`/`promote`/`undo` → suggest `active.task` if set.

---

## Override prefixes

User can bypass the router and force a verb:
- `must do: <verb> <args>` → Stage 1 only; never fall through.
- `just do: <verb> <args>` → same.
- `exactly: <verb> <args>` → same.

These prefixes also bypass any confirmation prompts in the backing scripts (treat as `--force`).

---

## Disable mechanism

- `AF_PLAN_ROUTING_DISABLED=true` → skill exits early, `/aura-frog:plan` falls back to direct script invocation per command file protocol.

- `rules/workflow/run-plan-bridge.md` — anchor /run to active T4.
- `rules/core/plan-trust-policy.md` — when memory vs plan tree conflict, prefer plan.
- `rules/workflow/checkpoint-discipline.md` — checkpoint format + when required.
