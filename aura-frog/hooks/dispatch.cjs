/**
 * dispatch.cjs — run several hook scripts inside ONE node process.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * hooks.json used to register 54 separate `node <script>.cjs` commands. A
 * single Read tool call fired 5 of them on PreToolUse alone; measured on a
 * 48GB M-series box that was ~536ms wall and ~45MB peak RSS *per script* —
 * pure interpreter boot, repeated. Multiply by PostToolUse, by the eh plugin's
 * own 31 hooks, and by the 5-7 parallel subagents an /eh:autopilot or
 * /eh:code-review run fans out to, and hook boot dominates both latency and
 * page-fault pressure.
 *
 * Node boot is ~40ms of each script's ~58ms. Folding N scripts into one
 * process removes (N-1) boots.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS
 * ------------
 * Every hook script in this directory (49 of 50) ends with the standard
 * `if (require.main === module) main()` guard and reads its payload through
 * lib/safe-stdin.cjs. So we can:
 *   1. read fd 0 once, into RAW;
 *   2. seed the require cache with a safe-stdin whose readStdinSafely()
 *      replays RAW (fd 0 is drained after the first read — replaying is the
 *      whole trick), and patch fs.readFileSync(0) for the 5 scripts that
 *      bypass the lib;
 *   3. load each script with process.mainModule pointed at it, so its
 *      require.main guard fires;
 *   4. intercept process.exit so one script exiting doesn't kill the rest.
 *
 * EXIT SEMANTICS
 * --------------
 * Claude Code treats exit 2 as "block the tool call" and shows stderr to the
 * model. We preserve that: the first script to exit non-zero wins, its stderr
 * is forwarded, and remaining scripts are skipped — same as the sequential
 * chain, where a blocking hook aborted the rest.
 *
 * WAITING FOR ASYNC WORK
 * ----------------------
 * We do not wait between hooks, and the process is never force-exited on the
 * happy path. Each hook's synchronous part runs to completion, then the next
 * starts; whatever async work a hook left behind drains on the shared event
 * loop and the process exits naturally once it is done — the same lifetime the
 * hook had when it owned its own process.
 *
 * Waiting per hook was tried and removed. Only 44 of 50 hooks call
 * process.exit; for the other six (prompt-reminder is one, and it runs on every
 * UserPromptSubmit) there is no completion signal to wait for, so any bounded
 * wait cost the full timeout on every prompt. Watching live handles instead
 * does not work either: a timer left behind by an earlier hook sits in the next
 * hook's baseline, so when that straggler fires the next hook looks finished
 * and gets cut short.
 *
 * SAFETY
 * ------
 * Blast radius is every tool call in every session, so:
 *   - AF_DISPATCH_DISABLED=1 falls back to spawning each script as before;
 *   - a dispatcher-level crash falls back to spawning, but only if no hook has
 *     run yet — re-running hooks would repeat their side effects;
 *   - an unref'd watchdog (AF_DISPATCH_TIMEOUT_MS, default 5000) force-exits if
 *     a hook leaks a live handle, so a leak cannot wedge the user's tool call.
 *
 * USAGE (from hooks.json)
 *   node dispatch.cjs scout-block pre-flight-validate
 *   node dispatch.cjs '>tool-call-tracer+CLAUDE_HOOK_PHASE=pre' auto-learn
