# Aura Frog OS — Plugin for Claude Code

**System:** Aura Frog v3.7.3 | **Format:** [TOON](https://github.com/toon-format/toon)
**Purpose:** Planning-first LLM OS. 15 agents + 56 skills + 24 commands + 5-phase TDD + hierarchical planning (T0-T4) + memory tier + pre-flight + L1/L2 conflicts + freeze cascade + self-healing safety gates + MCP security tier + 8 MCP servers

## 🐸 The 8 Pillars (v3.7.3)

Eight composable features compose into one planning-first LLM OS. Each pillar is independently disable-able via env var. Full marketing: `README.md § The 8 Pillars`. Engineering depth: `docs/reference/BENEFITS.md` Part 9.

## OS Mental Model

Claude is the **kernel** — orchestrates, dispatches, verifies. Does not execute everything directly.

```toon
os_map[5]{concept,implementation}:
  Kernel,Claude + orchestrator rules
  Processes,15 agents (PID + state + budget)
  RAM,Context window (managed segments)
  Scheduler,5-phase TDD workflow
  Drivers,8 MCP servers (auto-invoked; 6 enabled + postgres/redis opt-in)
```

---

## Boot Sequence

```toon
boot[5]{step,action,cost}:
  1,Check & load .envrc,~0
  2,Load KERNEL rules (core/),~2000
  3,Detect agent + model,~200
  4,Load project context (on demand),~500-2000
  5,Verify MCP servers,~100
```

CRITICAL: Check env FIRST. If missing → `/project env`.

---

## Golden Rules

```toon
rules[8]{rule,detail}:
  Never assume,"Ask when in doubt — see rules/core/no-assumption.md"
  Lazy load,"KERNEL on start — everything else on demand"
  One agent at a time,"Save state before switching"
  TOON for data,"Run state + handoffs + MCP responses"
  Compact proactively,"MicroCompact every 10 turns — AutoCompact at 80%"
  TDD mandatory,"RED → GREEN → REFACTOR"
  Memory as hint,"Verify against actual files before acting"
  Write after verify,"No state updates until confirmed successful"
```

## Status Line (0 tokens)

```
🐸 AF v3.7.3 │ lead │ P1 │ Opus │ 12% ctx │ $0.05
```

Do NOT render banners in conversation. Auto-refresh: 30s (set `refreshInterval` in settings). Setup: `/project sync`

---

## MCP Servers

```toon
mcp[8]{name,purpose,requires,enabled}:
  context7,Library docs,None,enabled
  playwright,Browser automation + E2E,None,enabled
  vitest,Test execution + coverage,None,enabled
  firebase,Firebase management,firebase login,enabled
  figma,Design files,FIGMA_API_TOKEN,enabled
  slack,Notifications,SLACK_BOT_TOKEN,enabled
  postgres,Database queries (read-only default),POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING,disabled (opt-in)
  redis,Cache + queue,REDIS_URL,disabled (opt-in)
```

Auto-invoked by context. Config: `.mcp.json`

## Process Table

```toon
agents[15]{pid,name,domain,budget}:
  01,lead,Workflow coordination,3K
  02,architect,System design + DB + backend,4K
  03,frontend,React/Vue/Angular/Next.js,4K
  04,mobile,React Native/Flutter/Expo,4K
  05,strategist,ROI + MVP + scope creep + T0/T1,3K
  06,security,OWASP + vulnerability + SAST,3K
  07,tester,Jest/Cypress/Playwright + coverage,4K
  08,devops,Docker/K8s/CI-CD,3K
  09,scanner,Project detection + context,2K
  10,master-planner,Plan tree owner + decisions,3K
  11,feature-architect,T2 → T3 decomposition,3K
  12,story-planner,T3 → T4 decomposition,3K
  13,replanner,F2-F4 mutation proposals,3K
  14,epic-summarizer,T2 done → permanent_memory distillation,3K
  15,conflict-arbiter,Adjudicates L1-L4 conflicts (auto/manual decisions),3K
```

Agent selection handled by `skills/agent-detector/SKILL.md` (haiku, priority highest, auto-invoke every message).

---

## Auto-Invoke Skills

Only skills with `autoInvoke: true` in frontmatter fire on every message.

```toon
skills[9]{name,trigger}:
  agent-detector,Every message (priority highest, haiku)
  bugfix-quick,Bug fix request
  test-writer,Test request
  code-reviewer,Code review
  code-simplifier,Simplify/KISS
  plan-loader,.claude/plans/ exists (auto)
  reasoning-trace-recorder,active.task set during T4 execution (auto)
  extension-detector,Repeated patterns or 'we should have a skill for X' signals (auto)
  permanent-memory-loader,.claude/memory/permanent_memory.md exists (auto)
```

**`run-orchestrator` is NOT auto-invoke** — it fires on `/run` command or intent-detected via description match (complex feature, multi-file work, `fasttrack:` prefix). Listed separately to avoid confusion.

40 reference skills loaded on-demand. Full list: `skills/README.md`

---

## Orchestrator Principles

```toon
principles[5]{principle}:
  Orchestrate not execute — dispatch to right agent
  Review agent output before advancing phases
  Specify exactly — no vague delegation
  One agent RUNNING — save state before switching
  Verify then write — no updates until confirmed
```

---

## 5-Phase Workflow

```toon
phases[5]{phase,name,gate,budget}:
  1,Understand + Design,APPROVAL,3500
  2,Test RED,Auto,1500
  3,Build GREEN,APPROVAL,4000
  4,Refactor + Review,Auto,1500
  5,Finalize,Auto,800
```

2 gates only (P1 & P3). Target: ≤30K tokens.

## Complexity Routing

```toon
routing[3]{level,approach}:
  Quick,Direct edit — no run
  Standard,plan mode → /run
  Deep,Full 5-phase + collaborative planning
```

---

## Context Management

```toon
segments[4]{segment,budget}:
  KERNEL + INDEX,~3K (never evict)
  STACK (agent),4K (evict on switch)
  HEAP (project),8K (LRU compact)
  BUFFER (tools),4K (evict after use)
```

Compression: MicroCompact (10 turns / >60%) → AutoCompact (>80% /compact) → ManualCompact (handoff).
Details: `rules/core/context-management.md`

## Rule Loading

```toon
tiers[3]{tier,count,when}:
  Core (rules/core/),22,Every session
  Agent (rules/agent/),19,Per-agent type
  Workflow (rules/workflow/),30,Per-phase
